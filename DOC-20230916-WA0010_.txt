02/06/2023, 23:09 - Koyel Mondal: 55.	Prove that (𝐴𝑐 ∩ 𝐵𝑐 ) = (𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)𝑐, by the notion of set theoretic operations. 
ChatGPT
To prove that (𝐴𝑐 ∩ 𝐵𝑐) = (𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)𝑐, we need to show that the left-hand side (LHS) is equal to the right-hand side (RHS) by using the properties of set theory.

Let's start by analyzing each side separately:

LHS: (𝐴𝑐 ∩ 𝐵𝑐)

This represents the intersection of the complements of sets A and B.
RHS: (𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)𝑐

This represents the complement of the union of sets A and B.
To prove their equality, we need to show that any element in LHS is also in RHS, and vice versa.

Element in LHS ⇒ Element in RHS:
Let x be an arbitrary element in (𝐴𝑐 ∩ 𝐵𝑐). This means that x is in the complement of A and x is in the complement of B. In other words, x is not in A and x is not in B.
Since x is not in A, x must be in the complement of A, denoted as A𝑐. Similarly, since x is not in B, x must be in the complement of B, denoted as B𝑐. Therefore, x is in the intersection of A𝑐 and B𝑐.

Now, let's consider the complement of the union of sets A and B, denoted as (𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)𝑐. Any element in this complement is not in the union of sets A and B. Since x is not in A and x is not in B, x is not in their union (A ∪ B). Hence, x is also in (𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)𝑐.

Thus, we have shown that any element in LHS is also in RHS.

Element in RHS ⇒ Element in LHS:
Let y be an arbitrary element in (𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)𝑐. This means that y is not in the union of sets A and B.
Suppose y is in A. In this case, y is also in the union of sets A and B (A ∪ B), which contradicts the assumption that y is not in their union. Therefore, y cannot be in A.

Similarly, suppose y is in B. Again, y would be in the union of sets A and B (A ∪ B), contradicting the assumption that y is not in their union. Thus, y cannot be in B.

Since y is not in A and y is not in B, y is in the complement of A (A𝑐) and y is in the complement of B (B𝑐). Therefore, y is in the intersection of A𝑐 and B𝑐.

Hence, we have shown that any element in RHS is also in LHS.

Since we have proven both directions, we can conclude that (𝐴𝑐 ∩ 𝐵𝑐) = (𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)𝑐.

56.	Define equivalence relation. Give an example of equivalence relation. 
ChatGPT
An equivalence relation is a relation defined on a set that satisfies three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.

Reflexivity: For any element a in the set, the relation must hold true between a and itself. In other words, a is related to itself.

Symmetry: If a is related to b, then b is also related to a. The relation is symmetric.

Transitivity: If a is related to b and b is related to c, then a is related to c. The relation is transitive.

Example of an equivalence relation:

Consider the set of all people. We can define a relation "has the same height as" on this set. Let's denote this relation as ~.

Reflexivity: For any person a, a ~ a since a has the same height as itself.

Symmetry: If person a has the same height as person b, then person b also has the same height as person a. The relation is symmetric.

Transitivity: If person a has the same height as person b, and person b has the same height as person c, then person a has the same height as person c. The relation is transitive.

Therefore, the relation "has the same height as" satisfies all three properties of an equivalence relation.

57.	Define Partial order relation. Give an example of partial order relation. 
ChatGPT
A partial order relation, also known as a partial order, is a binary relation defined on a set that satisfies three properties: reflexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity.

Reflexivity: For any element a in the set, the relation must hold true between a and itself. In other words, a is related to itself.

Antisymmetry: If a is related to b and b is related to a, then a and b must be the same element. In other words, if a is related to b and b is related to a, then a = b.

Transitivity: If a is related to b and b is related to c, then a is related to c. The relation is transitive.

Example of a partial order relation:

Consider the set of all natural numbers (positive integers), denoted as N. We can define a relation "divides" on this set. Let's denote this relation as |.

For any two natural numbers a and b, we say that a divides b (a | b) if b is divisible by a without any remainder.

Reflexivity: For any natural number a, a divides itself since a multiplied by 1 equals a.

Antisymmetry: If a divides b (a | b) and b divides a (b | a), then a and b must be the same number. In other words, if a | b and b | a, then a = b.

Transitivity: If a divides b (a | b) and b divides c (b | c), then a divides c (a | c). This follows from the transitivity of the division operation.

Therefore, the relation "divides" on the set of natural numbers satisfies all three properties of a partial order relation.

58.	State the Pigeonhole Principle.  Hence prove that there exists a power of 3 that ends with 0001. 
ChatGPT
The Pigeonhole Principle states that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes and you distribute the pigeons into the pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. In other words, if there are more items to distribute than there are available options, then there must be at least one option that has more than one item.

Now, let's prove that there exists a power of 3 that ends with 0001 using the Pigeonhole Principle:

Consider the set of numbers formed by the last four digits of the powers of 3. We can represent these numbers as:

3^1 mod 10000 = 0003
3^2 mod 10000 = 0009
3^3 mod 10000 = 0027
3^4 mod 10000 = 0081
3^5 mod 10000 = 0243
3^6 mod 10000 = 0729
...

We can observe that the numbers formed by the last four digits of the powers of 3 are repeating. Since we have 10,000 possible combinations for the last four digits (from 0000 to 9999), and there are an infinite number of powers of 3, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two powers of 3 must have the same last four digits.

Let's say 3^a mod 10000 and 3^b mod 10000 have the same last four digits, where a > b. This means that (3^a - 3^b) is divisible by 10000.

Now, let's consider the difference between these two powers of 3:

3^a - 3^b = 3^b * (3^(a-b) - 1)

Since (3^(a-b) - 1) is an integer, we can conclude that 3^a - 3^b is divisible by 10000.

In other words, 3^a ≡ 3^b (mod 10000).

Now, let's focus on the last digit of these two powers of 3, which is the unit digit. Since 3^a ≡ 3^b (mod 10), the last digit of 3^a and 3^b must be the same.

Let's consider the case where the last digit is 1.

If the last digit of 3^a is 1, it means that 3^a ends with 0001.

Therefore, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must exist a power of 3 that ends with 0001.

59.	Give examples of two functions such that their composition is surjective, and one of them is surjective but other is neither surjective nor injective.  
ChatGPT
Sure! Let's consider the following functions:

Function f: R → R (real numbers to real numbers) defined as f(x) = 2x.

Function g: R → R defined as g(x) = sin(x).

f(x) = 2x:
This function is surjective since for any real number y, we can find x = y/2 such that f(x) = y. In other words, every real number has a pre-image under f.

g(x) = sin(x):
This function is neither surjective nor injective.

Surjectivity: The range of the sine function is between -1 and 1, which means there are real numbers that are not in the range of g. For example, there is no real number x for which g(x) = 2.

Injectivity: The sine function is periodic, with a period of 2π. This means that different values of x can yield the same value of g(x). For example, g(0) = g(2π) = 0, so the function is not injective.

Now, let's consider the composition of these two functions: (f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)).

The composition (f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(sin(x)) = 2sin(x).

Surjectivity of the composition: The function 2sin(x) is surjective since the range of sin(x) is between -1 and 1, and multiplying it by 2 expands the range to include all real numbers. Therefore, (f ∘ g)(x) = 2sin(x) is surjective.
Hence, we have an example where the composition of two functions is surjective, with one of the functions being surjective (f(x) = 2x) and the other function (g(x) = sin(x)) being neither surjective nor injective.

60.	Find the remainder, when the sum 13 + 23 + 33 + … +1003 is divided by 5. 
ChatGPT
To find the remainder when the sum 13 + 23 + 33 + ... + 1003 is divided by 5, we can analyze the pattern of the terms and their remainders.

We notice that each term in the given sum can be expressed as 10n + 3, where n represents the position of the term.

Let's examine the remainders when the terms are divided by 5:

When n = 1: 10n + 3 = 10(1) + 3 = 13 (remainder = 3 when divided by 5)
When n = 2: 10n + 3 = 10(2) + 3 = 23 (remainder = 3 when divided by 5)
When n = 3: 10n + 3 = 10(3) + 3 = 33 (remainder = 3 when divided by 5)
...
When n = 100: 10n + 3 = 10(100) + 3 = 1003 (remainder = 3 when divided by 5)

We can observe that every term has a remainder of 3 when divided by 5.

Now, let's consider the sum of these remainders:
3 + 3 + 3 + ... + 3 (100 terms)

Since we have 100 terms, the sum of the remainders will be 3 multiplied by 100, which equals 300.

Therefore, the remainder when the sum 13 + 23 + 33 + ... + 1003 is divided by 5 is 300 divided by 5, which is 0.

Hence, the remainder is 0.

61.	Find all possible left cosets in    of {(e, (1 3 2), (1 2 3)}.  
ChatGPT
To find all possible left cosets in the group S₃ (permutations of three elements) of the subgroup H generated by {(e, (1 3 2), (1 2 3)} (where e denotes the identity element), we need to left multiply each element of H by each element of S₃.

First, let's calculate the elements of H:
H = {e, (1 3 2), (1 2 3)}

Now, let's multiply each element of H by each element of S₃ to find the left cosets:

eH = {e * e, e * (1 3 2), e * (1 2 3)} = {e, (1 3 2), (1 2 3)}

(1 2)H = {(1 2) * e, (1 2) * (1 3 2), (1 2) * (1 2 3)} = { (1 2), (1 3), (2 3) }

(1 3)H = {(1 3) * e, (1 3) * (1 3 2), (1 3) * (1 2 3)} = { (1 3), (2 3), (1 2) }

(2 3)H = {(2 3) * e, (2 3) * (1 3 2), (2 3) * (1 2 3)} = { (2 3), (1 2), (1 3) }

(1 2 3)H = {(1 2 3) * e, (1 2 3) * (1 3 2), (1 2 3) * (1 2 3)} = { (1 2 3), (1 3 2), (2 3 1) }

(1 3 2)H = {(1 3 2) * e, (1 3 2) * (1 3 2), (1 3 2) * (1 2 3)} = { (1 3 2), (2 1 3), (3 2 1) }

These are all the possible left cosets of H in S₃.

Note: The operation used for the coset multiplication is composition of permutations.

62.	Let f(x) be a polynomial with integer coefficients. If f(x) = 5, for 3 distinct integers, then show that, for no integer x, f(x) can be equal to 4, by Pigeonhole principle.    
ChatGPT
To prove that for no integer x, f(x) can be equal to 4 given that f(x) = 5 for three distinct integers, we will use the Pigeonhole Principle.

Suppose that there exists an integer x for which f(x) = 4. We will show that this assumption leads to a contradiction using the Pigeonhole Principle.

Consider the set of three distinct integers for which f(x) = 5. Let's denote these integers as a, b, and c.

Now, let's define a function g(x) = f(x) - 1. Note that g(x) is also a polynomial with integer coefficients.

We know that f(a) = f(b) = f(c) = 5, which means that g(a) = g(b) = g(c) = 4.

If we assume that f(x) = 4 for some integer x, it implies that g(x) = f(x) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 for that particular value of x.

Now, let's consider the function g(x) - 3. If g(x) = 3, then g(x) - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0.

By the Pigeonhole Principle, since we have three distinct integers a, b, and c for which g(a) = g(b) = g(c) = 4, and we have an additional value x for which g(x) = 3, it means that there are at least two integers among a, b, c, and x that have the same value when plugged into g(x) - 3.

However, this contradicts the assumption that a, b, c are distinct integers. Therefore, our initial assumption that f(x) = 4 for some integer x leads to a contradiction.

Hence, we can conclude that for no integer x, f(x) can be equal to 4, given that f(x) = 5 for three distinct integers.

63.	Define an abelian group. Give an example of a cyclic and a non-cyclic group. 
ChatGPT
An abelian group, also known as a commutative group, is a group in which the group operation is commutative. In other words, for any elements a and b in the group, the order of the operation does not affect the result: a * b = b * a.

Formally, an abelian group is a set G equipped with an operation "*" that satisfies the following properties:

Closure: For any elements a and b in G, the result of the operation a * b is also an element of G.

Associativity: For any elements a, b, and c in G, the operation is associative: (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).

Identity element: There exists an element e in G, called the identity element, such that for any element a in G, a * e = e * a = a.

Inverse element: For every element a in G, there exists an element b in G, called the inverse element of a, such that a * b = b * a = e.

Commutativity: For any elements a and b in G, the operation is commutative: a * b = b * a.

Example of a cyclic group:
A cyclic group is a group generated by a single element. One example of a cyclic group is the group of integers under addition, denoted as (Z, +). The element 1 generates this group, and every element in the group can be expressed as a power of 1. For example, the elements of (Z, +) are {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.

Example of a non-cyclic group:
The symmetric group of degree 3, denoted as S₃, is an example of a non-cyclic group. It consists of all possible permutations of three elements, and the group operation is the composition of permutations. The elements of S₃ are {e, (1 2), (1 3), (2 3), (1 2 3), (1 3 2)}, where e denotes the identity permutation. The symmetric group S₃ is non-cyclic because no single element generates the entire group.

64.	Find the number of reflexive and symmetric relations can be defined on a set having n           elements.  
ChatGPT
To find the number of reflexive and symmetric relations that can be defined on a set with n elements, we will analyze each property separately.

Reflexive relations:
A relation on a set is reflexive if every element of the set is related to itself. In other words, for each element x in the set, the pair (x, x) is in the relation.
For a set with n elements, there are n choices for the first element of the pair (x, x) and n choices for the second element. Since each element can be related to itself or not, there are 2 options for each pair. Therefore, the total number of reflexive relations is 2^(n^2) since we have n^2 pairs in total.

Symmetric relations:
A relation on a set is symmetric if whenever (a, b) is in the relation, then (b, a) is also in the relation. In other words, if (a, b) is in the relation, then (b, a) must also be in the relation.
To count the number of symmetric relations, we need to consider all possible subsets of pairs. Let's say the set has n elements. For each pair (a, b) in the relation, we have two choices: either include both (a, b) and (b, a) in the relation or exclude both. Therefore, for each pair, we have 2 options. Since there are n(n+1)/2 pairs (including both (a, b) and (b, a) pairs as distinct), the total number of symmetric relations is 2^(n(n+1)/2).

To summarize:

The number of reflexive relations on a set with n elements is 2^(n^2).
The number of symmetric relations on a set with n elements is 2^(n(n+1)/2).
Note that these calculations assume that the empty set and the entire set are considered relations. If we exclude these trivial cases, we need to subtract 2 from the above calculations.

65.	Show that the number of positive integers not exceeding 2001, that are multiple of 3 or 4 but not 5, is 801. 
ChatGPT
To find the number of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 5, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Let's denote the set of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 3 as A, the set of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 4 as B, and the set of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 5 as C.

We need to find the number of elements in the set (A ∪ B) ∩ C' where C' represents the complement of C.

First, let's calculate the number of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 3. The largest multiple of 3 that does not exceed 2001 is 1998, which is divisible by 3. Dividing 1998 by 3 gives us 666. So, there are 666 positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 3.

Next, let's calculate the number of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 4. The largest multiple of 4 that does not exceed 2001 is 2000, which is divisible by 4. Dividing 2000 by 4 gives us 500. So, there are 500 positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 4.

Now, let's calculate the number of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 5. The largest multiple of 5 that does not exceed 2001 is 2000, which is divisible by 5. Dividing 2000 by 5 gives us 400. So, there are 400 positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 5.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can find the number of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 5:

|A ∪ B ∪ C'| = |A ∪ B| - |A ∪ B ∩ C| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

|A ∪ B ∪ C'| = 666 + 500 - (2000/15) - (2000/20) + (2000/60) = 666 + 500 - 133 - 100 + 33 = 966.

So, there are 966 positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 5.

However, we need to find the number of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 5. To find this, we need to subtract the multiples of 15 (common multiples of 3 and 5) from the total.

The largest multiple of 15 that does not exceed 2001 is 1995. Dividing 1995 by 15 gives us 133. So, there are 133 positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 15.

Therefore, the number of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 5 is 966 - 133 = 833.

Hence, the number of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 5 is 833.
02/06/2023, 23:09 - Koyel Mondal: 66.	Prove by the mathematical induction that 𝑎3 − 𝑎 is divisible by 5, for all integer 𝑎 > 3. 
ChatGPT
To prove that 𝑎^3 - 𝑎 is divisible by 5 for all integers 𝑎 > 3, we will use mathematical induction.

Step 1: Base Case
Let's consider the base case where 𝑎 = 4. We have:
4^3 - 4 = 64 - 4 = 60.

Since 60 is divisible by 5 (60 = 5 * 12), the statement holds true for 𝑎 = 4.

Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis
Assume that for some integer 𝑘 > 3, 𝑘^3 - 𝑘 is divisible by 5. This is our inductive hypothesis.

Step 3: Inductive Step
We need to show that if the statement is true for 𝑘, then it is also true for 𝑘 + 1.

Let's consider 𝑘 + 1:
(𝑘 + 1)^3 - (𝑘 + 1) = 𝑘^3 + 3𝑘^2 + 3𝑘 + 1 - 𝑘 - 1 = 𝑘^3 + 3𝑘^2 + 2𝑘.

Using our inductive hypothesis, we know that 𝑘^3 - 𝑘 is divisible by 5. So, we can express 𝑘^3 - 𝑘 as 5𝑛 for some integer 𝑛.

(𝑘 + 1)^3 - (𝑘 + 1) = 𝑘^3 + 3𝑘^2 + 2𝑘 = (5𝑛 + 𝑘) + 3𝑘^2 + 2𝑘 = 5𝑛 + 3𝑘^2 + 3𝑘 = 5𝑛 + 3(𝑘^2 + 𝑘).

The term 3(𝑘^2 + 𝑘) is a multiple of 5 since it is the product of 3 and an integer 𝑘^2 + 𝑘. Therefore, (𝑘 + 1)^3 - (𝑘 + 1) is divisible by 5.

By mathematical induction, we have shown that 𝑎^3 - 𝑎 is divisible by 5 for all integers 𝑎 > 3.

67.	Show that  𝑛! ≤ 2𝑛, ∀ 𝑛 ≥ 1,  natural number
ChatGPT
To show that 𝑛! ≤ 2𝑛 for all 𝑛 ≥ 1, we will use mathematical induction.

Step 1: Base Case
Let's consider the base case where 𝑛 = 1. We have:
1! = 1 and 2𝑛 = 2.

Since 1 ≤ 2, the statement holds true for 𝑛 = 1.

Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis
Assume that for some natural number 𝑘 ≥ 1, 𝑘! ≤ 2𝑘. This is our inductive hypothesis.

Step 3: Inductive Step
We need to show that if the statement is true for 𝑘, then it is also true for 𝑘 + 1.

Let's consider 𝑘 + 1:
(𝑘 + 1)! = (𝑘 + 1)𝑘!

Using our inductive hypothesis, we know that 𝑘! ≤ 2𝑘. So, we can express 𝑘! as 2𝑘 or 𝑘! ≤ 2𝑘.

Multiplying both sides of the inequality by (𝑘 + 1), we have:
(𝑘 + 1)𝑘! ≤ (𝑘 + 1)(2𝑘).

Expanding the right side, we get:
(𝑘 + 1)𝑘! ≤ 2𝑘^2 + 2𝑘.

We can rewrite 2𝑘^2 + 2𝑘 as 2(𝑘^2 + 𝑘), which is clearly greater than or equal to (𝑘 + 1)(𝑘) for 𝑘 ≥ 1.

Therefore, we have:
(𝑘 + 1)𝑘! ≤ 2(𝑘^2 + 𝑘) ≤ 2(𝑘 + 1)(𝑘) = 2(𝑘 + 1)!.

By mathematical induction, we have shown that 𝑛! ≤ 2𝑛 for all 𝑛 ≥ 1.

ChatGPT
To show that at least one number in the sequence 0.7, 0.77, 0.777, ..., 0.7777....7, ... is divisible by 2023, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle.

Consider the remainders when each number in the sequence is divided by 2023. Since we have infinitely many numbers in the sequence, but only a finite number of possible remainders (2023 possible remainders), by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must exist two numbers in the sequence that have the same remainder when divided by 2023.

Let's assume we have two numbers in the sequence that have the same remainder when divided by 2023. Without loss of generality, let's say the numbers are of the form:

0.777...7 and 0.777...7 (with the same number of 7s)

Subtracting these two numbers, we get:

0.777...7 - 0.777...7 = 0.000...0 (with the same number of 0s)

This difference is equal to zero, which is divisible by any number, including 2023.

Therefore, at least one number in the sequence 0.7, 0.77, 0.777, ..., 0.7777....7, ... is surely divisible by 2023.

ChatGPT
To ensure that at least 4 balls are of the same color, we can consider the worst-case scenario, where we draw the minimum number of balls required to guarantee this outcome.

Let's analyze each case individually:

Worst-case scenario for having 4 red balls:
In the worst-case scenario, we can draw 3 red balls, 3 white balls, and 3 blue balls. This gives us a total of 9 balls. However, if we draw 1 more ball, it is guaranteed that we will have at least 4 balls of the same color (red). Therefore, we need to draw a minimum of 9 + 1 = 10 balls.

Worst-case scenario for having 4 white balls:
Similarly, in the worst-case scenario, we can draw 3 red balls, 3 white balls, and 3 blue balls, totaling 9 balls. By drawing 1 more ball, we are ensured to have at least 4 balls of the same color (white). Thus, we need to draw a minimum of 9 + 1 = 10 balls.

Worst-case scenario for having 4 blue balls:
Again, in the worst-case scenario, we draw 3 red balls, 3 white balls, and 3 blue balls, giving us a total of 9 balls. Drawing 1 additional ball guarantees that we will have at least 4 balls of the same color (blue). Hence, we need to draw a minimum of 9 + 1 = 10 balls.

Therefore, in order to ensure that at least 4 balls are of the same color, we must draw a minimum of 10 balls from the bag.

70.	How many integers between 1 to 1000 inclusive, do not share a common factor with 1000.  
ChatGPT
To determine the number of integers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) that do not share a common factor with 1000, we need to find the count of integers that are relatively prime to 1000.

We can use Euler's totient function (φ-function) to calculate the count of relatively prime numbers. The formula for φ-function states that for any positive integer 𝑛, the count of positive integers less than or equal to 𝑛 and relatively prime to 𝑛 is given by:

φ(𝑛) = 𝑛 * (1 - 1/𝑝₁) * (1 - 1/𝑝₂) * ... * (1 - 1/𝑝𝑘),

where 𝑝₁, 𝑝₂, ..., 𝑝𝑘 are the distinct prime factors of 𝑛.

In the case of 1000, the prime factorization is 2^3 * 5^3. Therefore, we have:

φ(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 400.

So, there are 400 integers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) that do not share a common factor with 1000.

71.	Show that there are binary sequence containing exactly p 0’s and q 1’s with q ≥ p – 1, with no two zeros together is   
ChatGPT
To show that there are binary sequences containing exactly p 0's and q 1's, where q ≥ p - 1, with no two zeros together, we can use a combinatorial argument.

Consider a binary sequence of length p + q where we need to place p 0's and q 1's with the condition that no two zeros are together. Let's denote 0 as 'O' and 1 as 'I' to differentiate between the two elements.

We will construct such a sequence by considering the following steps:

Step 1: Place all the q 1's first. Since q ≥ p - 1, we have enough 1's to place. We can represent this as the sequence 'II...I' where there are q 1's.

Step 2: Now, we have p + q - q = p 0's left to place. We will insert these zeros among the q 1's in such a way that no two zeros are together.

To achieve this, we will consider the q 1's as positions where we can insert the p 0's. Since there are q 1's and p 0's, we can think of this as placing the p 0's in the q + 1 available positions (including the edges).

Using the stars and bars combinatorial argument, we can determine that the number of ways to place p 0's among q + 1 positions without any two zeros together is given by (q + 1 - p) choose p.

This means that there are (q + 1 - p) choose p ways to construct such a binary sequence.

Therefore, we have shown that there are binary sequences containing exactly p 0's and q 1's, where q ≥ p - 1, with no two zeros together.

By modus ponens, from 𝑟 and 𝑟 ⟶ 𝑞, we can deduce 𝑞.
We have ~𝑞 from step 2 and 𝑞 from step 4.
From steps 5 and 1, we can apply reductio ad absurdum to derive ~𝑝, which is the negation of the assumption 𝑝.
Therefore, we have shown that assuming 𝑝, 𝑟, 𝑝 ⟶ ~𝑞, and 𝑟 ⟶ 𝑞 lead to the conclusion ~𝑝. Thus, the argument 𝑝 ⟶ ~𝑞, 𝑟 ⟶ 𝑞, 𝑟 ⊢ ~𝑝 is valid.

73.	Show that, the argument given 𝑝 ⟶  𝑞, ~ 𝑝 ⊢ ~𝑞 is a fallacy. 
ChatGPT
To show that the argument 𝑝 ⟶ 𝑞, ~𝑝 ⊢ ~𝑞 is a fallacy, we can provide a counterexample that demonstrates its invalidity.

Let's consider the following values for 𝑝 and 𝑞:

𝑝: It is true.
𝑞: It is false.

Using these values, we can evaluate the premises and the conclusion of the argument:

𝑝 ⟶ 𝑞: Since 𝑝 is true and 𝑞 is false, the statement 𝑝 ⟶ 𝑞 is false.
~𝑝: Since 𝑝 is true, ~𝑝 is false.
~𝑞: According to the conclusion, ~𝑞 should be true.
However, in our chosen example, ~𝑞 is false since 𝑞 is false.

Therefore, we have found a specific case where the premises 𝑝 ⟶ 𝑞 and ~𝑝 are true, but the conclusion ~𝑞 is false. This demonstrates that the argument 𝑝 ⟶ 𝑞, ~𝑝 ⊢ ~𝑞 is invalid, making it a fallacy.

. Construct the truth table of {(𝑝 ∧ ~𝑞) → 𝑟} ⟶ {𝑝 ⟶ (𝑞 ∨ 𝑟).  
ChatGPT
To construct the truth table for the statement {(𝑝 ∧ ~𝑞) → 𝑟} ⟶ {𝑝 ⟶ (𝑞 ∨ 𝑟)}, we need to consider all possible combinations of truth values for the variables 𝑝, 𝑞, and 𝑟.

Let's create a truth table with columns for 𝑝, 𝑞, 𝑟, (𝑝 ∧ ~𝑞), (𝑝 ∧ ~𝑞) → 𝑟, 𝑝 ⟶ (𝑞 ∨ 𝑟), and the final implication {(𝑝 ∧ ~𝑞) → 𝑟} ⟶ {𝑝 ⟶ (𝑞 ∨ 𝑟)}.

Here's the truth table:

𝑝	𝑞	𝑟	(𝑝 ∧ ~𝑞)	(𝑝 ∧ ~𝑞) → 𝑟	𝑝 ⟶ (𝑞 ∨ 𝑟)	{(𝑝 ∧ ~𝑞) → 𝑟} ⟶ {𝑝 ⟶ (𝑞 ∨ 𝑟)}

In the truth table, T represents true, and F represents false. By evaluating the statement for all possible combinations of truth values, we can see that the final implication {(𝑝 ∧ ~𝑞) → 𝑟} ⟶ {𝑝 ⟶ (𝑞 ∨ 𝑟)} is always true. Therefore, the statement is a tautology, meaning it is true for all possible truth value assignments.

To test the equivalence of the two logical statements ¬(¬𝑝 ⋀ 𝑞) ⋁ 𝑞 and 𝑝 ⋁ 𝑞, we can construct their truth tables and compare the resulting truth values for all possible combinations of truth values for 𝑝 and 𝑞.

Let's create a truth table with columns for 𝑝, 𝑞, ¬(¬𝑝 ⋀ 𝑞), ¬(¬𝑝 ⋀ 𝑞) ⋁ 𝑞, 𝑝 ⋁ 𝑞, and check if the two statements always have the same truth value.

ChatGPT
To find the solution of the congruence equation 5𝑥 ≡ 14 (mod 24), we need to find an integer 𝑥 that satisfies the equation.

First, let's find the modular inverse of 5 modulo 24. The modular inverse of 5 (mod 24) is 5 itself since 5 * 5 ≡ 1 (mod 24).

Now, we can multiply both sides of the congruence equation by the modular inverse of 5:

5𝑥 * 5 ≡ 14 * 5 (mod 24)
25𝑥 ≡ 70 (mod 24)

Since 25 ≡ 1 (mod 24), we have:

𝑥 ≡ 70 * 1 (mod 24)
𝑥 ≡ 70 (mod 24)

To find the smallest non-negative solution, we can reduce 70 modulo 24:

𝑥 ≡ 70 % 24
𝑥 ≡ 22 (mod 24)

Therefore, the solution to the congruence equation 5𝑥 ≡ 14 (mod 24) is 𝑥 ≡ 22 (mod 24).

To show that the expression ((𝑝 ∨ 𝑞) ∧∼ (∼ 𝑝 ∧ (∼ 𝑞 ∨∼ 𝑟))) ∨ (∼ 𝑝 ∧∼ 𝑞) ∨ (∼ 𝑝 ∧∼ 𝑟) is a tautology, we can construct a truth table and verify that the expression evaluates to true for all possible truth value assignments to 𝑝, 𝑞, and 𝑟.

79.	Using Euclidean Algorithm, find the solution of Diophantine Equation: 243x + 315y = 9. 
ChatGPT
To solve the Diophantine equation 243𝑥 + 315𝑦 = 9 using the Euclidean algorithm, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 243 and 315.

Step 1: Apply the Euclidean algorithm
Divide 315 by 243:
315 = 243 × 1 + 72

Step 2: Repeat the process with the previous divisor and the remainder
Divide 243 by 72:
243 = 72 × 3 + 27

Step 3: Repeat the process again
Divide 72 by 27:
72 = 27 × 2 + 18

Step 4: Repeat once more
Divide 27 by 18:
27 = 18 × 1 + 9

Step 5: Final step
Divide 18 by 9:
18 = 9 × 2 + 0

The final non-zero remainder we obtain is 9. Therefore, the GCD of 243 and 315 is 9.

Step 6: Express the GCD as a linear combination
Working backward, we can express the GCD of 9 as a linear combination of 243 and 315:
9 = 27 - 18
= 27 - (72 - 27 × 2)
= 27 × 3 - 72
= (243 - 72 × 3) × 3 - 72
= 243 × 3 - 72 × 9
= 243 × 3 + 315 × (-3)

From this, we can see that 𝑥 = 3 and 𝑦 = -3 satisfy the Diophantine equation 243𝑥 + 315𝑦 = 9.

ChatGPT
A group homomorphism is a function between two groups that preserves the group operation. More formally, let (𝐺, ⋆) and (𝐻, ∘) be two groups. A function 𝑓: 𝐺 → 𝐻 is called a group homomorphism if it satisfies the following property:

For all elements 𝑎, 𝑏 in 𝐺, 𝑓(𝑎 ⋆ 𝑏) = 𝑓(𝑎) ∘ 𝑓(𝑏).

Now let's test if 𝑓: (ℝ, +) → (ℝ⁺, ×) defined by 𝑓(𝑥) = 2𝑥 is a group homomorphism.

For any 𝑎, 𝑏 in ℝ, we need to check if 𝑓(𝑎 + 𝑏) = 𝑓(𝑎) × 𝑓(𝑏).

Let's compute 𝑓(𝑎 + 𝑏):
𝑓(𝑎 + 𝑏) = 2(𝑎 + 𝑏) = 2𝑎 + 2𝑏

Now let's compute 𝑓(𝑎) × 𝑓(𝑏):
𝑓(𝑎) × 𝑓(𝑏) = (2𝑎) × (2𝑏) = 4𝑎𝑏

We can observe that 𝑓(𝑎 + 𝑏) = 2𝑎 + 2𝑏 and 𝑓(𝑎) × 𝑓(𝑏) = 4𝑎𝑏 are not equal for all 𝑎 and 𝑏 in ℝ. Therefore, 𝑓(𝑥) = 2𝑥 is not a group homomorphism from (ℝ, +) to (ℝ⁺, ×).

83.	Define Planar graph. Illustrate the dual of a planar graph. What is the minimum number of edges necessary in a simple planar graph with 15 regions? 
ChatGPT
A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn on a plane (or a flat surface) in such a way that no edges intersect except at their endpoints. In other words, a planar graph is a graph that can be represented without any edges crossing.

The dual of a planar graph is obtained by assigning a vertex to each face or region of the original planar graph, and connecting two vertices in the dual if the corresponding regions share an edge in the original graph. In other words, the dual graph has a vertex for each region and an edge between two vertices if the corresponding regions share a common edge.

To determine the minimum number of edges necessary in a simple planar graph with 15 regions, we can use Euler's formula, which states that for a connected planar graph with V vertices, E edges, and F faces (including the outer face), the following relationship holds:

V - E + F = 2.

In this case, we have F = 15 (15 regions). Let's assume the graph is connected, so V is equal to the number of vertices in the graph.

Using Euler's formula, we can rearrange the equation to solve for E:

E = V + F - 2.

Since we want to minimize the number of edges, we want to minimize E. This occurs when the graph is a tree (a connected acyclic graph), which has the minimum number of edges for a given number of vertices.

For a tree with V vertices, the number of edges is V - 1. Therefore, in a simple planar graph with 15 regions, the minimum number of edges necessary is 15 - 1 = 14.

85.	The chromatic polynomial of the cycle of size n is (𝑥 − 1)𝑛 + (−1)𝑛(𝑥 − 1). 
 
ChatGPT
The statement you provided is incorrect. The correct chromatic polynomial of a cycle of size n is:

𝑃(𝑥) = 𝑥(𝑥 − 1)^(n-1)

Let's break down the reasoning behind this formula.

In a cycle of size n, each vertex is connected to two adjacent vertices, forming a circular structure. To assign colors to the vertices in such a way that no adjacent vertices have the same color, we start by assigning any color to the first vertex. Then, for each subsequent vertex, we have (𝑥 - 1) choices for the color, as we cannot use the same color as its adjacent vertex. Therefore, the chromatic polynomial is 𝑥(𝑥 - 1)^(n-1).

Let's illustrate this with an example:

For a cycle of size 3 (a triangle), the chromatic polynomial is 𝑥(𝑥 - 1)^(3-1) = 𝑥(𝑥 - 1)^2 = 𝑥(𝑥^2 - 2𝑥 + 1) = 𝑥^3 - 2𝑥^2 + 𝑥.

For a cycle of size 4 (a square), the chromatic polynomial is 𝑥(𝑥 - 1)^(4-1) = 𝑥(𝑥 - 1)^3 = 𝑥(𝑥^3 - 3𝑥^2 + 3𝑥 - 1) = 𝑥^4 - 3𝑥^3 + 3𝑥^2 - 𝑥.

You can see that the correct chromatic polynomial follows the pattern of 𝑥^n - (n-1)𝑥^(n-1) + ... + (-1)^(n-1)𝑥, with alternating signs for each term except the first one.

87.	(i) The identity element in G is unique.    (ii) (𝑎−1)−1 = 𝑎 .  
ChatGPT
(i) To prove that the identity element in a group G is unique, we need to show that there cannot be two distinct identity elements in G.

Let's assume that G is a group and suppose there exist two distinct identity elements, denoted as e and e'. We want to show that e and e' are actually the same element.

By definition, the identity element e satisfies the property that for any element a in G, ae = ea = a. Similarly, the identity element e' satisfies the same property.

Now, let's consider the product e'e. Since e is an identity element, we have e'e = e. However, since e' is also an identity element, we have e'e = e'. Therefore, we have e = e', which means that the assumed distinct identity elements e and e' are actually the same element.

Hence, we have proved that the identity element in G is unique.

(ii) To prove that (a^(-1))^(-1) = a for any element a in a group G, we need to show that the inverse of the inverse of a is equal to a.

Let's consider an element a in G and its inverse, denoted as a^(-1). By definition, a^(-1) is the unique element in G such that a * a^(-1) = a^(-1) * a = e, where e is the identity element in G.

Now, let's consider the inverse of a^(-1), which is (a^(-1))^(-1). By definition, (a^(-1))^(-1) is the unique element in G such that a^(-1) * (a^(-1))^(-1) = (a^(-1))^(-1) * a^(-1) = e.

We want to show that (a^(-1))^(-1) = a. Let's multiply both sides of the equation a * a^(-1) = e by a^(-1):

a * a^(-1) * a^(-1) = e * a^(-1)
a * (a^(-1) * a^(-1)) = a^(-1)
a * (a^(-1))^(-1) = a^(-1)

Since a * (a^(-1))^(-1) = a^(-1) and a^(-1) * (a^(-1))^(-1) = e, we can conclude that (a^(-1))^(-1) = a.

Therefore, we have proved that (a^(-1))^(-1) = a for any element a in a group G.

88.	Prove that for any tree G = (V, E), |E| = |V| - 1. 
ChatGPT
To prove that for any tree G = (V, E), the number of edges |E| is equal to the number of vertices |V| minus 1, we can use the concept of tree properties.

A tree is defined as an undirected connected acyclic graph. Let's assume G is a tree with |V| vertices and |E| edges.

First, we will show that if G is a tree, then it is acyclic. Since a tree is defined as an acyclic graph, this property holds by definition.

Next, we will prove that if G is a tree, then it is connected. A tree is a connected graph, which means there is a path between any two vertices in the graph. If G is not connected, there would be at least two disjoint components, and it would not satisfy the definition of a tree. Therefore, G must be connected.

Now, let's use the concept of a spanning tree. A spanning tree of a connected graph is a subgraph that contains all the vertices of the original graph and is itself a tree. In other words, a spanning tree of G is a tree that includes all the vertices of G.

A spanning tree of G will have |V| - 1 edges. This is because, in a tree, the number of edges is always one less than the number of vertices. Every edge added to a tree creates a new vertex, and hence the number of edges is incremented by one.

Since G is a tree, any subgraph of G, including a spanning tree, will have |V| - 1 edges. Therefore, |E| = |V| - 1 for any tree G.

Hence, we have proved that for any tree G = (V, E), the number of edges |E| is equal to the number of vertices |V| minus 1.

89.	Show that (ℝ , +, *) is a field. Is it an integral domain – Justify. 
ChatGPT
To show that (ℝ, +, *) is a field, we need to demonstrate that it satisfies the properties of a field: addition and multiplication are well-defined operations, it is closed under addition and multiplication, it has an identity element for both operations, every element has an additive inverse, and every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.

Addition and multiplication: In ℝ, addition (+) and multiplication (*) are well-defined operations. Adding or multiplying any two real numbers always yields a real number.

Closure under addition and multiplication: For any two real numbers a and b, the sum a + b and the product a * b are both real numbers. Therefore, ℝ is closed under addition and multiplication.

Identity elements: The identity element for addition in ℝ is 0, as for any real number a, a + 0 = 0 + a = a. The identity element for multiplication in ℝ is 1, as for any real number a, a * 1 = 1 * a = a.

Additive inverses: For every real number a, there exists an additive inverse (-a) such that a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0. This means that every element in ℝ has an additive inverse.

Multiplicative inverses: For every non-zero real number a, there exists a multiplicative inverse (1/a) such that a * (1/a) = (1/a) * a = 1. This means that every non-zero element in ℝ has a multiplicative inverse.

Therefore, (ℝ, +, *) satisfies all the properties of a field.

Now, let's discuss whether (ℝ, +, *) is an integral domain. An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity where no zero divisors exist. In other words, in an integral domain, if a * b = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0.

(ℝ, +, *) is not an integral domain because it does have zero divisors. For example, consider the real numbers a = 0 and b = 2. Although a * b = 0, where a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0, we have a non-zero element b such that the product a * b is zero.

Therefore, (ℝ, +, *) is a field but not an integral domain.

90.	Define Planar graph. Illustrate the dual of a planar graph. What is the minimum number of edges necessary in a simple planar graph with 15 regions? 
ChatGPT
A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn on a plane without any of its edges crossing each other. In other words, it is a graph that can be represented without any edge intersections.

The dual of a planar graph is a graph obtained by assigning a vertex to each face (region) of the original planar graph and connecting two vertices if their corresponding faces share an edge. The dual graph provides a different representation of the relationships between regions in the original graph.

To determine the minimum number of edges necessary in a simple planar graph with 15 regions, we can make use of Euler's formula for planar graphs. Euler's formula states that for a connected planar graph with V vertices, E edges, and F faces (regions), the following equation holds:

V - E + F = 2

In this case, we have F = 15 (15 regions) and we want to find the minimum number of edges (E). Since the graph is simple, each edge is shared by two regions. So, the total number of edges is given by E = (2 * F)/2 = F.

Substituting F = 15 into the equation, we get:

V - E + 15 = 2

Rearranging the equation, we have:

E = V + 13

To minimize the number of edges (E), we need to minimize the number of vertices (V). In a simple planar graph, the minimum number of vertices required is 3, as a planar graph with fewer than 3 vertices cannot form any regions. Therefore, the minimum number of edges necessary in a simple planar graph with 15 regions is:

E = 3 + 13 = 16

Hence, a simple planar graph with 15 regions must have a minimum of 16 edges.

To compute 52022 modulo 17, we need to find the remainder when 52022 is divided by 17.

52022 divided by 17 is equal to 3060 with a remainder of 2. This means that 52022 can be expressed as 17 times 3060 plus 2.

Therefore, the remainder when 52022 is divided by 17 is 2.

Hence, 52022 modulo 17 is equal to 2.

92.	Show that,   is a group. Is it a cyclic group – Justify. 
ChatGPT
To determine if the set G = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} with the operation * defined as a * b = a + b - 6 is a group, we need to verify four conditions: closure, associativity, existence of an identity element, and existence of inverses.

Closure: For any two elements a and b in G, a * b = a + b - 6. Since the sum of two elements from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is always in the range [2, 9], and subtracting 6 from this range gives us {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, we see that a * b is always an element in G. Therefore, closure is satisfied.

Associativity: Since addition is associative, the operation * is also associative. For any three elements a, b, and c in G, (a * b) * c = (a + b - 6) + c - 6 = a + (b + c) - 12 = a + (b + c - 6) - 6 = a * (b * c). Hence, associativity is satisfied.

Identity element: An identity element e in a group satisfies the property a * e = a = e * a for all elements a in the group. In G, we can observe that 3 is the identity element. For any element a in G, a * 3 = a + 3 - 6 = a. Also, 3 * a = 3 + a - 6 = a. Thus, the identity element 3 exists in G.

Inverses: Every element in G has an inverse. For any element a in G, its inverse is given by (6 - a). This is because a * (6 - a) = a + (6 - a) - 6 = 6 - 6 = 0, which is the identity element. Similarly, (6 - a) * a = (6 - a) + a - 6 = 6 - 6 = 0. Thus, every element in G has an inverse.

Therefore, G = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} with the operation * defined as a + b - 6 is a group.

Now, let's determine if G is a cyclic group. A group G is cyclic if there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be expressed as a power of g. In other words, G is cyclic if there is a generator for G.

In this case, we can see that there is no single element in G that can generate all other elements. For example, if we start with the element 1 and apply the operation * repeatedly, we can generate the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, but we cannot generate 6 or any other element larger than 5. Similarly, starting with any other element does not generate all the elements of G.

Therefore, G = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} with the operation * is not a cyclic group since there is no generator for the group.

P: Surojit solve this problem.

The argument can be represented as follows:

T	F	F	F	T
F	T	T	T	F
F	F	T	F	F
From the truth table, we can see that whenever the premises (If P, then Q and Q) are both true, the conclusion (P) is also true. Therefore, the argument is valid.

In other words, if Surojit solves the problem (P), and Surojit scores 90 (Q), then it follows that Surojit indeed solves the problem (P).

ChatGPT
To show that there are binary sequences containing exactly q 0's and p 1's with p ≥ q - 1, and no two zeros are together, we can use combinatorial reasoning.

Consider the following approach:

Start with a sequence of p 1's: 1111...1 (p times).

Now we have p + 1 gaps between the 1's where the 0's can be placed. We need to distribute q 0's in these gaps such that no two zeros are together.

Since no two zeros can be together, we can place at most one zero in each gap. This means that out of p + 1 gaps, we need to select q gaps to place the zeros.

The number of ways to select q gaps out of p + 1 gaps is given by the binomial coefficient (p+1)Cq.

Therefore, the total number of binary sequences satisfying the given conditions is (p+1)Cq.

Now let's check the condition p ≥ q - 1:

If p ≥ q - 1, then p + 1 ≥ q.

Therefore, (p+1)Cq is defined and represents the number of ways to select q gaps out of p + 1 gaps.

Hence, there are binary sequences containing exactly q 0's and p 1's with p ≥ q - 1, and no two zeros are together.

96.	Show that a cycle with n vertices is not perfect if n is odd and greater than 3.  
ChatGPT
To show that a cycle with n vertices is not perfect if n is odd and greater than 3, we need to demonstrate the existence of an odd cycle in the complement of the given cycle.

A perfect graph is defined as a graph in which the size of the largest clique is equal to the chromatic number. In other words, a graph is perfect if and only if its complement is also perfect.

Consider a cycle with n vertices, denoted as C_n. If n is odd and greater than 3, then n is at least 5.

Now, let's consider the complement of C_n. The complement of C_n will be a graph with the same set of vertices, where two vertices are adjacent in the complement if and only if they are not adjacent in C_n.

Since C_n is a cycle, every vertex is adjacent to exactly two other vertices. In the complement, this means that every vertex is not adjacent to exactly two other vertices.

Now, let's consider the subgraph of the complement induced by these vertices that are not adjacent to each other. This subgraph is an odd cycle with at least 5 vertices because we have at least 5 vertices that are pairwise non-adjacent.

Since an odd cycle is not perfect (its chromatic number is 3 and it does not have a clique of size 3), it follows that the complement of C_n is not perfect.

Therefore, the cycle C_n with n vertices is not perfect if n is odd and greater than 3.

To find the sum of the coefficients in the chromatic polynomial, we substitute x = 1 into the polynomial and evaluate it:

P(G, 1) = 1(1-1)^(n-1) = 0^(n-1) = 0

Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the chromatic polynomial is 0 when G has at least one edge.

98.	Show that (ℤ5, +5) forms a field under addition and multiplication modulo class.  
ChatGPT
To show that (ℤ5, +5) forms a field under addition and multiplication modulo class, we need to demonstrate that the following properties hold:

Closure: For any a, b ∈ ℤ5, the sum a +5 b and product a ×5 b are also in ℤ5.

Associativity: Addition and multiplication in ℤ5 are associative operations. That is, for any a, b, and c ∈ ℤ5, (a +5 b) +5 c = a +5 (b +5 c) and (a ×5 b) ×5 c = a ×5 (b ×5 c).

Identity elements: There exist additive and multiplicative identity elements in ℤ5. The additive identity is 0, and the multiplicative identity is 1.

Inverse elements: For every element a ∈ ℤ5, there exists an additive inverse (-a) and a multiplicative inverse (if a ≠ 0) such that a +5 (-a) = 0 and a ×5 a^(-1) = 1.

Commutativity: Addition and multiplication in ℤ5 are commutative operations. That is, for any a and b ∈ ℤ5, a +5 b = b +5 a and a ×5 b = b ×5 a.

Let's verify each of these properties:

Closure: Since ℤ5 consists of the elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, adding or multiplying any two elements will result in another element in ℤ5. Therefore, closure holds.

Associativity: Addition and multiplication are associative operations in ℤ5 as they are modulo operations. Hence, associativity holds.

Identity elements: The additive identity is 0, as 0 +5 a = a +5 0 = a for any a ∈ ℤ5. The multiplicative identity is 1, as 1 ×5 a = a ×5 1 = a for any a ∈ ℤ5. Therefore, identity elements exist.

Inverse elements: For every element a ∈ ℤ5, the additive inverse is (-a), where a +5 (-a) = (-a) +5 a = 0. The multiplicative inverse exists for every non-zero element a ∈ ℤ5. For example, the multiplicative inverse of 1 is 1, as 1 ×5 1 = 1. Similarly, the multiplicative inverse of 2 is 3, as 2 ×5 3 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Therefore, inverse elements exist.

Commutativity: Addition and multiplication are commutative operations in ℤ5. For any a and b ∈ ℤ5, a +5 b = b +5 a and a ×5 b = b ×5 a. Thus, commutativity holds.

Since all the required properties are satisfied, we can conclude that (ℤ5, +5) forms a field under addition and multiplication modulo class.

99.	State Lagrange’s Theorem for finite group. Establish by an example that every divisor of a finite group may not have a subgroup of the order.  
ChatGPT
Lagrange's theorem states that for any finite group G, the order of any subgroup H of G divides the order of G. Mathematically, if G is a finite group and H is a subgroup of G, then |H| divides |G|, where |H| denotes the order of the subgroup H, and |G| denotes the order of the group G.

Now, let's establish by an example that every divisor of a finite group may not have a subgroup of that order.

Consider the symmetric group S3, which consists of all permutations of three elements {1, 2, 3}. The order of S3 is 3! = 6.

Divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

Now, let's see if there exist subgroups of S3 with orders 1, 2, 3, and 6:

Subgroup of order 1: The subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element, has order 1. This subgroup exists.

Subgroup of order 2: There is no subgroup of order 2 in S3. The only elements of order 2 in S3 are (1 2) and (2 3), but they do not generate a subgroup of order 2.

Subgroup of order 3: The subgroup generated by the element (1 2 3) has order 3. This subgroup exists.

Subgroup of order 6: The entire group S3 is the only subgroup of order 6. In this case, the divisor 6 does have a subgroup of order 6.

From this example, we can see that not every divisor of a finite group has a subgroup of that order. In the case of S3, there is no subgroup of order 2, even though 2 is a divisor of the group's order.

100.	Show that (𝑆3, 𝑜) is a non-abelian group of permutation of 3 elements. 
ChatGPT
To show that (S3, o) is a non-abelian group of permutations of 3 elements, we need to demonstrate two things:

The operation o (composition) is well-defined and associative.
The group (S3, o) is non-abelian, meaning there exist permutations in S3 that do not commute under the operation o.
Let's prove these two points:

Associativity:
To show that the operation o is associative, we need to verify that for any permutations a, b, and c in S3, (a o b) o c = a o (b o c).
Let's take three arbitrary permutations in S3:

a = (a1 a2 a3)
b = (b1 b2 b3)
c = (c1 c2 c3)

Now, let's compute (a o b) o c:

(a o b) o c = ((a1 a2 a3) o (b1 b2 b3)) o (c1 c2 c3)

By applying the composition operation o, we get:

(a o b) o c = (a1 a2 a3)(b1 b2 b3)(c1 c2 c3)

Next, let's compute a o (b o c):

a o (b o c) = (a1 a2 a3) o ((b1 b2 b3) o (c1 c2 c3))

Again, by applying the composition operation o, we get:

a o (b o c) = (a1 a2 a3)((b1 b2 b3)(c1 c2 c3))

If we evaluate both expressions, we will find that they yield the same result. Therefore, the operation o is associative in S3.

Non-abelian Property:
To show that (S3, o) is non-abelian, we need to find two permutations a and b in S3 such that a o b is not equal to b o a.
Let's consider the permutations:

a = (1 2 3)
b = (1 3 2)

If we compute a o b and b o a, we get:

a o b = (1 2 3)(1 3 2) = (1 3)(2)
b o a = (1 3 2)(1 2 3) = (2 3)(1)

We can observe that (1 3)(2) is not equal to (2 3)(1). Therefore, a o b is not equal to b o a.

Since we have shown that the operation o is well-defined, associative, and (S3, o) is non-abelian, we can conclude that (S3, o) is a non-abelian group of permutations of 3 elements.

101.	Prove that a group G is an abelian if and only if, for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1 hold.  
ChatGPT
To prove that a group G is abelian if and only if, for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1 holds, we need to show two implications:

If G is abelian, then for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1.
If for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1 holds, then G is abelian.
Let's prove each implication:

If G is abelian, then for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1.
Assume G is an abelian group. Let 𝑎, 𝑏 be arbitrary elements of G.

We want to show that (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1.

Using the property of inverses in a group, we have:

(𝑎𝑏)−1 = (𝑏−1𝑎−1) [Multiplying both sides by 𝑏−1𝑎−1]

Since G is abelian, we know that 𝑎𝑏 = 𝑏𝑎. Therefore:

(𝑎𝑏)−1 = (𝑏𝑎)−1

Now, applying the property of inverses again, we have:

(𝑏𝑎)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1

Hence, we have shown that for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1.

If for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1 holds, then G is abelian.
Assume that for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1 holds.

To prove that G is abelian, we need to show that for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, 𝑎𝑏 = 𝑏𝑎.

Let 𝑎, 𝑏 be arbitrary elements of G.

Consider the product (𝑎𝑏)−1:

(𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1 [Using the given condition]

Now, take the inverse of both sides:

((𝑎𝑏)−1)−1 = (𝑎−1𝑏−1)−1

𝑎𝑏 = 𝑏𝑎

Hence, we have shown that for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, 𝑎𝑏 = 𝑏𝑎, which implies that G is abelian.

Therefore, we have proven both implications, and we can conclude that a group G is abelian if and only if, for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1 holds

102.	Prove that every finite integral domain is a field. 
ChatGPT
To prove that every finite integral domain is a field, we need to show that every non-zero element in the integral domain has a multiplicative inverse.

Let D be a finite integral domain and let a be a non-zero element in D. We want to show that a has a multiplicative inverse.

Since D is an integral domain, every non-zero element is cancellable. This means that if a⋅b = a⋅c for non-zero elements a, b, and c, then b = c.

Consider the set {a⋅k | k ∈ D}. Since D is finite, this set is also finite.

Since D is a finite integral domain, there are no zero divisors, which means that no two distinct elements in D can have the same product with a. In other words, for any two distinct elements k₁, k₂ ∈ D, if a⋅k₁ = a⋅k₂, then k₁ = k₂.

Therefore, each element in the set {a⋅k | k ∈ D} is distinct.

Since D is finite, there must exist k₁, k₂ ∈ D such that a⋅k₁ = a⋅k₂ and k₁ ≠ k₂.

Using the cancellability property of integral domains, we can cancel a from both sides of the equation to get k₁ = k₂.

This contradicts our assumption that k₁ and k₂ are distinct.

Hence, it must be the case that for every element k in D, a⋅k is unique.

Now, consider the set {a⋅k | k ∈ D}. Since each element a⋅k is unique, and D is finite, this set contains all non-zero elements of D.

Since the set contains all non-zero elements, there must exist an element k' ∈ D such that a⋅k' = 1 (the multiplicative identity).

Therefore, every non-zero element in D has a multiplicative inverse, and D is a field.

Hence, we have proven that every finite integral domain is a field.

103.	Find the all cosets of 𝐻 = {±1, ±𝑖} in group 𝐺 = {±1, ±𝑖, ±𝑗, ±𝑘} with respect to  multiplication as operation.  
ChatGPT
To find all the cosets of the subgroup H = {±1, ±𝑖} in the group G = {±1, ±𝑖, ±𝑗, ±𝑘} with respect to multiplication as the operation, we need to determine the left cosets of H in G.

The left coset of H in G is given by the set gH = {gh | h ∈ H}, where g is an element of G.

Let's determine the left cosets:

For g = ±1:
gH = {±1h | h ∈ H} = {±1, ±𝑖}

For g = ±𝑖:
gH = {±𝑖h | h ∈ H} = {±𝑖, ±𝑖²} = {±𝑖, ±1}

For g = ±𝑗:
gH = {±𝑗h | h ∈ H} = {±𝑗h | h ∈ {±1, ±𝑖}} = {±𝑗, ±𝑗𝑖, ±𝑗(−1), ±𝑗(−𝑖)} = {±𝑗, ±𝑘, ±(−𝑗), ±(−𝑘)}

For g = ±𝑘:
gH = {±𝑘h | h ∈ H} = {±𝑘h | h ∈ {±1, ±𝑖}} = {±𝑘, ±𝑘𝑖, ±(−𝑘), ±(−𝑘𝑖)} = {±𝑘, ±𝑗, ±(−𝑘), ±(−𝑗)}

So, the cosets of H in G are:
H = {±1, ±𝑖}
𝑖H = {±𝑖, ±1}
𝑗H = {±𝑗, ±𝑘, ±(−𝑗), ±(−𝑘)}
𝑘H = {±𝑘, ±𝑗, ±(−𝑘), ±(−𝑗)}

These are the four distinct left cosets of H in G with respect to multiplication as the operation.

104.	Show that the proposition 𝑝 ⋁ ~(𝑝 ∧ 𝑞) is a tautology
ChatGPT
To show that the proposition 𝑝 ⋁ ~(𝑝 ∧ 𝑞) is a tautology, we need to demonstrate that it is always true regardless of the truth values of 𝑝 and 𝑞.

We can construct a truth table to evaluate the proposition for all possible combinations of truth values for 𝑝 and 𝑞:

𝑝	𝑞	𝑝 ∧ 𝑞	~(𝑝 ∧ 𝑞)	𝑝 ⋁ ~(𝑝 ∧ 𝑞)
T	T	T	F	T
T	F	F	T	T
F	T	F	T	T
F	F	F	T	T
From the truth table, we can see that regardless of the truth values of 𝑝 and 𝑞, the proposition 𝑝 ⋁ ~(𝑝 ∧ 𝑞) always evaluates to true (T).

Therefore, we can conclude that the proposition 𝑝 ⋁ ~(𝑝 ∧ 𝑞) is a tautology.

106.	Find the all-possible solutions of  217𝑥 ≡  238 (𝑚𝑜𝑑 327).    
ChatGPT
To find all possible solutions of the congruence equation 217𝑥 ≡ 238 (mod 327), we need to solve for 𝑥.

First, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 217 and 327, which is 1:

217𝑥 ≡ 238 (mod 327)

Next, we need to find the modular inverse of 217 modulo 327. Let's use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find it:

327 = 1 * 217 + 110
217 = 1 * 110 + 107
110 = 1 * 107 + 3
107 = 35 * 3 + 2
3 = 1 * 2 + 1

Now, we can work our way back up to find the coefficients of the linear combination:

1 = 3 - 1 * 2
= 3 - 1 * (107 - 35 * 3)
= 36 * 3 - 1 * 107
= 36 * (110 - 107) - 1 * 107
= 36 * 110 - 37 * 107
= 36 * 110 - 37 * (217 - 110)
= 73 * 110 - 37 * 217
= 73 * (327 - 217) - 37 * 217
= 73 * 327 - 110 * 217

Therefore, the modular inverse of 217 modulo 327 is -110 (or 217) since we are working in the modulo 327 system.

Now, we can multiply both sides of the congruence equation by the modular inverse (-110 or 217):

-110 * 217𝑥 ≡ -110 * 238 (mod 327)
-23870𝑥 ≡ -26080 (mod 327)

Since -110 * 217 ≡ 1 (mod 327), we have:

𝑥 ≡ -26080 ≡ 47 (mod 327)

So, the possible solutions for 𝑥 are all the integers that are congruent to 47 modulo 327.

107.	Prove that the relation R defined by “a is congruent to b modulo m” on the set of integers (ℤ) is an equivalence relation. 
ChatGPT
To prove that the relation R defined by "a is congruent to b modulo m" on the set of integers (ℤ) is an equivalence relation, we need to show that it satisfies three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.

Reflexivity:
For any integer a, a is congruent to itself modulo m. In other words, a ≡ a (mod m). Therefore, the relation R is reflexive.

Symmetry:
If a is congruent to b modulo m, then b is also congruent to a modulo m. In other words, if a ≡ b (mod m), then b ≡ a (mod m). Therefore, the relation R is symmetric.

Transitivity:
If a is congruent to b modulo m, and b is congruent to c modulo m, then a is also congruent to c modulo m. In other words, if a ≡ b (mod m) and b ≡ c (mod m), then a ≡ c (mod m). Therefore, the relation R is transitive.

Since the relation R satisfies all three properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, we can conclude that the relation R defined by "a is congruent to b modulo m" on the set of integers (ℤ) is an equivalence relation.

109.	Find the multiplicative inverse of  29 in z*41
ChatGPT
To find the multiplicative inverse of 29 in ℤ*41 (the set of nonzero integers modulo 41), we need to find another number x such that the product of 29 and x is congruent to 1 modulo 41.

In other words, we want to find x such that 29x ≡ 1 (mod 41).

To solve this congruence equation, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Step 1: Apply the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of 29 and 41:

41 = 1 × 29 + 12
29 = 2 × 12 + 5
12 = 2 × 5 + 2
5 = 2 × 2 + 1

Step 2: Now, we can work backward to express 1 as a linear combination of 29 and 41:

1 = 5 - 2 × 2
= 5 - 2 × (12 - 2 × 5)
= 5 - 2 × 12 + 4 × 5
= -2 × 12 + 5 × 5
= -2 × 12 + 5 × (29 - 2 × 12)
= 5 × 29 - 12 × 2
= 5 × 29 - 12 × (41 - 1 × 29)
= 5 × 29 - 12 × 41 + 12 × 29
= 17 × 29 - 12 × 41

Step 3: Take the coefficient of 29, which is 17, as the multiplicative inverse of 29 modulo 41.

Therefore, the multiplicative inverse of 29 in ℤ*41 is 17.

110.	Show that center of a group denoted by Z(G) and defined by {x | ax = xa,  ∀ a ∈ G} is an abelian subgroup of any group G. Hence show that if G is cyclic then Z(G) is so.  
 
ChatGPT
To show that the center of a group, denoted by Z(G), is an abelian subgroup of any group G, we need to prove two properties:

Z(G) is a subgroup of G.
Z(G) is abelian, meaning that for any elements x, y in Z(G), xy = yx.
Let's prove these properties:

Z(G) is a subgroup of G:

Closure: Let x, y be elements of Z(G). For any element a in G, we have:
(xy)a = x(ya) (by associativity of the group operation)
= x(ay) (since y is in Z(G))
= (xa)y (by associativity of the group operation)
= (ax)y (since x is in Z(G))
= a(xy) (by associativity of the group operation)
This shows that xy is in Z(G), so Z(G) is closed under the group operation.
Identity: The identity element e of G is also in Z(G) since for any element a in G, we have ae = ea = a.
Inverses: For any element x in Z(G), its inverse x^(-1) is also in Z(G) since for any element a in G, we have:
(x^(-1))a = x^(-1)a = ax^(-1) = a(x^(-1)).
Therefore, Z(G) is a subgroup of G.
Z(G) is abelian:
Let x, y be elements of Z(G). For any element a in G, we have:
xy = (yx)a (by the definition of Z(G))
= y(xa) (by associativity of the group operation)
= y(ax) (since x is in Z(G))
= (ya)x (by associativity of the group operation)
= (ay)x (since y is in Z(G))
= a(yx) (by associativity of the group operation)
This shows that xy = yx, so Z(G) is abelian.

Therefore, the center of any group G, denoted by Z(G), is an abelian subgroup of G.

Now, let's show that if G is a cyclic group, then Z(G) is also a cyclic group.
Suppose G is a cyclic group generated by an element g. That is, every element of G can be written as a power of g.
Let x be an element in Z(G), which means gx = xg for all g in G.
Since G is cyclic, x can be written as a power of g, say x = g^k for some integer k.
Now, for any g' in G, we have:
g'x = g'g^k = (g'g)g^(k-1) = gg'g^(k-1) = xg' (using the commutativity of g' and g)
This shows that x is in Z(G) as well.
Therefore, Z(G) is also cyclic, generated by the same element g.

In conclusion, if G is a cyclic group, then its center Z(G) is also a cyclic group.

ChatGPT
To prove that (𝐴𝑐 ∩ 𝐵𝑐) = (𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)𝑐, we need to show that the left-hand side (LHS) is equal to the right-hand side (RHS) by using the properties of set theory.

Let's start by analyzing each side separately:

LHS: (𝐴𝑐 ∩ 𝐵𝑐)

This represents the intersection of the complements of sets A and B.
RHS: (𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)𝑐

This represents the complement of the union of sets A and B.
To prove their equality, we need to show that any element in LHS is also in RHS, and vice versa.

Element in LHS ⇒ Element in RHS:
Let x be an arbitrary element in (𝐴𝑐 ∩ 𝐵𝑐). This means that x is in the complement of A and x is in the complement of B. In other words, x is not in A and x is not in B.
Since x is not in A, x must be in the complement of A, denoted as A𝑐. Similarly, since x is not in B, x must be in the complement of B, denoted as B𝑐. Therefore, x is in the intersection of A𝑐 and B𝑐.

Now, let's consider the complement of the union of sets A and B, denoted as (𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)𝑐. Any element in this complement is not in the union of sets A and B. Since x is not in A and x is not in B, x is not in their union (A ∪ B). Hence, x is also in (𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)𝑐.

Thus, we have shown that any element in LHS is also in RHS.

Element in RHS ⇒ Element in LHS:
Let y be an arbitrary element in (𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)𝑐. This means that y is not in the union of sets A and B.
Suppose y is in A. In this case, y is also in the union of sets A and B (A ∪ B), which contradicts the assumption that y is not in their union. Therefore, y cannot be in A.

Similarly, suppose y is in B. Again, y would be in the union of sets A and B (A ∪ B), contradicting the assumption that y is not in their union. Thus, y cannot be in B.

Since y is not in A and y is not in B, y is in the complement of A (A𝑐) and y is in the complement of B (B𝑐). Therefore, y is in the intersection of A𝑐 and B𝑐.

Hence, we have shown that any element in RHS is also in LHS.

Since we have proven both directions, we can conclude that (𝐴𝑐 ∩ 𝐵𝑐) = (𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)𝑐.

56.	Define equivalence relation. Give an example of equivalence relation. 
ChatGPT
An equivalence relation is a relation defined on a set that satisfies three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.

Reflexivity: For any element a in the set, the relation must hold true between a and itself. In other words, a is related to itself.

Symmetry: If a is related to b, then b is also related to a. The relation is symmetric.

Transitivity: If a is related to b and b is related to c, then a is related to c. The relation is transitive.

Example of an equivalence relation:

Consider the set of all people. We can define a relation "has the same height as" on this set. Let's denote this relation as ~.

Reflexivity: For any person a, a ~ a since a has the same height as itself.

Symmetry: If person a has the same height as person b, then person b also has the same height as person a. The relation is symmetric.

Transitivity: If person a has the same height as person b, and person b has the same height as person c, then person a has the same height as person c. The relation is transitive.

Therefore, the relation "has the same height as" satisfies all three properties of an equivalence relation.

57.	Define Partial order relation. Give an example of partial order relation. 
ChatGPT
A partial order relation, also known as a partial order, is a binary relation defined on a set that satisfies three properties: reflexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity.

Reflexivity: For any element a in the set, the relation must hold true between a and itself. In other words, a is related to itself.

Antisymmetry: If a is related to b and b is related to a, then a and b must be the same element. In other words, if a is related to b and b is related to a, then a = b.

Transitivity: If a is related to b and b is related to c, then a is related to c. The relation is transitive.

Example of a partial order relation:

Consider the set of all natural numbers (positive integers), denoted as N. We can define a relation "divides" on this set. Let's denote this relation as |.

For any two natural numbers a and b, we say that a divides b (a | b) if b is divisible by a without any remainder.

Reflexivity: For any natural number a, a divides itself since a multiplied by 1 equals a.

Antisymmetry: If a divides b (a | b) and b divides a (b | a), then a and b must be the same number. In other words, if a | b and b | a, then a = b.

Transitivity: If a divides b (a | b) and b divides c (b | c), then a divides c (a | c). This follows from the transitivity of the division operation.

Therefore, the relation "divides" on the set of natural numbers satisfies all three properties of a partial order relation.

58.	State the Pigeonhole Principle.  Hence prove that there exists a power of 3 that ends with 0001. 
ChatGPT
The Pigeonhole Principle states that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes and you distribute the pigeons into the pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. In other words, if there are more items to distribute than there are available options, then there must be at least one option that has more than one item.

Now, let's prove that there exists a power of 3 that ends with 0001 using the Pigeonhole Principle:

Consider the set of numbers formed by the last four digits of the powers of 3. We can represent these numbers as:

3^1 mod 10000 = 0003
3^2 mod 10000 = 0009
3^3 mod 10000 = 0027
3^4 mod 10000 = 0081
3^5 mod 10000 = 0243
3^6 mod 10000 = 0729
...

We can observe that the numbers formed by the last four digits of the powers of 3 are repeating. Since we have 10,000 possible combinations for the last four digits (from 0000 to 9999), and there are an infinite number of powers of 3, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two powers of 3 must have the same last four digits.

Let's say 3^a mod 10000 and 3^b mod 10000 have the same last four digits, where a > b. This means that (3^a - 3^b) is divisible by 10000.

Now, let's consider the difference between these two powers of 3:

3^a - 3^b = 3^b * (3^(a-b) - 1)

Since (3^(a-b) - 1) is an integer, we can conclude that 3^a - 3^b is divisible by 10000.

In other words, 3^a ≡ 3^b (mod 10000).

Now, let's focus on the last digit of these two powers of 3, which is the unit digit. Since 3^a ≡ 3^b (mod 10), the last digit of 3^a and 3^b must be the same.

Let's consider the case where the last digit is 1.

If the last digit of 3^a is 1, it means that 3^a ends with 0001.

Therefore, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must exist a power of 3 that ends with 0001.

59.	Give examples of two functions such that their composition is surjective, and one of them is surjective but other is neither surjective nor injective.  
ChatGPT
Sure! Let's consider the following functions:

Function f: R → R (real numbers to real numbers) defined as f(x) = 2x.

Function g: R → R defined as g(x) = sin(x).

f(x) = 2x:
This function is surjective since for any real number y, we can find x = y/2 such that f(x) = y. In other words, every real number has a pre-image under f.

g(x) = sin(x):
This function is neither surjective nor injective.

Surjectivity: The range of the sine function is between -1 and 1, which means there are real numbers that are not in the range of g. For example, there is no real number x for which g(x) = 2.

Injectivity: The sine function is periodic, with a period of 2π. This means that different values of x can yield the same value of g(x). For example, g(0) = g(2π) = 0, so the function is not injective.

Now, let's consider the composition of these two functions: (f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)).

The composition (f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(sin(x)) = 2sin(x).

Surjectivity of the composition: The function 2sin(x) is surjective since the range of sin(x) is between -1 and 1, and multiplying it by 2 expands the range to include all real numbers. Therefore, (f ∘ g)(x) = 2sin(x) is surjective.
Hence, we have an example where the composition of two functions is surjective, with one of the functions being surjective (f(x) = 2x) and the other function (g(x) = sin(x)) being neither surjective nor injective.

60.	Find the remainder, when the sum 13 + 23 + 33 + … +1003 is divided by 5. 
ChatGPT
To find the remainder when the sum 13 + 23 + 33 + ... + 1003 is divided by 5, we can analyze the pattern of the terms and their remainders.

We notice that each term in the given sum can be expressed as 10n + 3, where n represents the position of the term.

Let's examine the remainders when the terms are divided by 5:

When n = 1: 10n + 3 = 10(1) + 3 = 13 (remainder = 3 when divided by 5)
When n = 2: 10n + 3 = 10(2) + 3 = 23 (remainder = 3 when divided by 5)
When n = 3: 10n + 3 = 10(3) + 3 = 33 (remainder = 3 when divided by 5)
...
When n = 100: 10n + 3 = 10(100) + 3 = 1003 (remainder = 3 when divided by 5)

We can observe that every term has a remainder of 3 when divided by 5.

Now, let's consider the sum of these remainders:
3 + 3 + 3 + ... + 3 (100 terms)

Since we have 100 terms, the sum of the remainders will be 3 multiplied by 100, which equals 300.

Therefore, the remainder when the sum 13 + 23 + 33 + ... + 1003 is divided by 5 is 300 divided by 5, which is 0.

Hence, the remainder is 0.

61.	Find all possible left cosets in    of {(e, (1 3 2), (1 2 3)}.  
ChatGPT
To find all possible left cosets in the group S₃ (permutations of three elements) of the subgroup H generated by {(e, (1 3 2), (1 2 3)} (where e denotes the identity element), we need to left multiply each element of H by each element of S₃.

First, let's calculate the elements of H:
H = {e, (1 3 2), (1 2 3)}

Now, let's multiply each element of H by each element of S₃ to find the left cosets:

eH = {e * e, e * (1 3 2), e * (1 2 3)} = {e, (1 3 2), (1 2 3)}

(1 2)H = {(1 2) * e, (1 2) * (1 3 2), (1 2) * (1 2 3)} = { (1 2), (1 3), (2 3) }

(1 3)H = {(1 3) * e, (1 3) * (1 3 2), (1 3) * (1 2 3)} = { (1 3), (2 3), (1 2) }

(2 3)H = {(2 3) * e, (2 3) * (1 3 2), (2 3) * (1 2 3)} = { (2 3), (1 2), (1 3) }

(1 2 3)H = {(1 2 3) * e, (1 2 3) * (1 3 2), (1 2 3) * (1 2 3)} = { (1 2 3), (1 3 2), (2 3 1) }

(1 3 2)H = {(1 3 2) * e, (1 3 2) * (1 3 2), (1 3 2) * (1 2 3)} = { (1 3 2), (2 1 3), (3 2 1) }

These are all the possible left cosets of H in S₃.

Note: The operation used for the coset multiplication is composition of permutations.

62.	Let f(x) be a polynomial with integer coefficients. If f(x) = 5, for 3 distinct integers, then show that, for no integer x, f(x) can be equal to 4, by Pigeonhole principle.    
ChatGPT
To prove that for no integer x, f(x) can be equal to 4 given that f(x) = 5 for three distinct integers, we will use the Pigeonhole Principle.

Suppose that there exists an integer x for which f(x) = 4. We will show that this assumption leads to a contradiction using the Pigeonhole Principle.

Consider the set of three distinct integers for which f(x) = 5. Let's denote these integers as a, b, and c.

Now, let's define a function g(x) = f(x) - 1. Note that g(x) is also a polynomial with integer coefficients.

We know that f(a) = f(b) = f(c) = 5, which means that g(a) = g(b) = g(c) = 4.

If we assume that f(x) = 4 for some integer x, it implies that g(x) = f(x) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 for that particular value of x.

Now, let's consider the function g(x) - 3. If g(x) = 3, then g(x) - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0.

By the Pigeonhole Principle, since we have three distinct integers a, b, and c for which g(a) = g(b) = g(c) = 4, and we have an additional value x for which g(x) = 3, it means that there are at least two integers among a, b, c, and x that have the same value when plugged into g(x) - 3.

However, this contradicts the assumption that a, b, c are distinct integers. Therefore, our initial assumption that f(x) = 4 for some integer x leads to a contradiction.

Hence, we can conclude that for no integer x, f(x) can be equal to 4, given that f(x) = 5 for three distinct integers.

63.	Define an abelian group. Give an example of a cyclic and a non-cyclic group. 
ChatGPT
An abelian group, also known as a commutative group, is a group in which the group operation is commutative. In other words, for any elements a and b in the group, the order of the operation does not affect the result: a * b = b * a.

Formally, an abelian group is a set G equipped with an operation "*" that satisfies the following properties:

Closure: For any elements a and b in G, the result of the operation a * b is also an element of G.

Associativity: For any elements a, b, and c in G, the operation is associative: (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).

Identity element: There exists an element e in G, called the identity element, such that for any element a in G, a * e = e * a = a.

Inverse element: For every element a in G, there exists an element b in G, called the inverse element of a, such that a * b = b * a = e.

Commutativity: For any elements a and b in G, the operation is commutative: a * b = b * a.

Example of a cyclic group:
A cyclic group is a group generated by a single element. One example of a cyclic group is the group of integers under addition, denoted as (Z, +). The element 1 generates this group, and every element in the group can be expressed as a power of 1. For example, the elements of (Z, +) are {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.

Example of a non-cyclic group:
The symmetric group of degree 3, denoted as S₃, is an example of a non-cyclic group. It consists of all possible permutations of three elements, and the group operation is the composition of permutations. The elements of S₃ are {e, (1 2), (1 3), (2 3), (1 2 3), (1 3 2)}, where e denotes the identity permutation. The symmetric group S₃ is non-cyclic because no single element generates the entire group.

64.	Find the number of reflexive and symmetric relations can be defined on a set having n           elements.  
ChatGPT
To find the number of reflexive and symmetric relations that can be defined on a set with n elements, we will analyze each property separately.

Reflexive relations:
A relation on a set is reflexive if every element of the set is related to itself. In other words, for each element x in the set, the pair (x, x) is in the relation.
For a set with n elements, there are n choices for the first element of the pair (x, x) and n choices for the second element. Since each element can be related to itself or not, there are 2 options for each pair. Therefore, the total number of reflexive relations is 2^(n^2) since we have n^2 pairs in total.

Symmetric relations:
A relation on a set is symmetric if whenever (a, b) is in the relation, then (b, a) is also in the relation. In other words, if (a, b) is in the relation, then (b, a) must also be in the relation.
To count the number of symmetric relations, we need to consider all possible subsets of pairs. Let's say the set has n elements. For each pair (a, b) in the relation, we have two choices: either include both (a, b) and (b, a) in the relation or exclude both. Therefore, for each pair, we have 2 options. Since there are n(n+1)/2 pairs (including both (a, b) and (b, a) pairs as distinct), the total number of symmetric relations is 2^(n(n+1)/2).

To summarize:

The number of reflexive relations on a set with n elements is 2^(n^2).
The number of symmetric relations on a set with n elements is 2^(n(n+1)/2).
Note that these calculations assume that the empty set and the entire set are considered relations. If we exclude these trivial cases, we need to subtract 2 from the above calculations.

65.	Show that the number of positive integers not exceeding 2001, that are multiple of 3 or 4 but not 5, is 801. 
ChatGPT
To find the number of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 5, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Let's denote the set of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 3 as A, the set of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 4 as B, and the set of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 5 as C.

We need to find the number of elements in the set (A ∪ B) ∩ C' where C' represents the complement of C.

First, let's calculate the number of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 3. The largest multiple of 3 that does not exceed 2001 is 1998, which is divisible by 3. Dividing 1998 by 3 gives us 666. So, there are 666 positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 3.

Next, let's calculate the number of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 4. The largest multiple of 4 that does not exceed 2001 is 2000, which is divisible by 4. Dividing 2000 by 4 gives us 500. So, there are 500 positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 4.

Now, let's calculate the number of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 5. The largest multiple of 5 that does not exceed 2001 is 2000, which is divisible by 5. Dividing 2000 by 5 gives us 400. So, there are 400 positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 5.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can find the number of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 5:

|A ∪ B ∪ C'| = |A ∪ B| - |A ∪ B ∩ C| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

|A ∪ B ∪ C'| = 666 + 500 - (2000/15) - (2000/20) + (2000/60) = 666 + 500 - 133 - 100 + 33 = 966.

So, there are 966 positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 5.

However, we need to find the number of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 5. To find this, we need to subtract the multiples of 15 (common multiples of 3 and 5) from the total.

The largest multiple of 15 that does not exceed 2001 is 1995. Dividing 1995 by 15 gives us 133. So, there are 133 positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 15.

Therefore, the number of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 5 is 966 - 133 = 833.

Hence, the number of positive integers not exceeding 2001 that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 5 is 833.
02/06/2023, 23:22 - Debasmita Raha: 66.	Prove by the mathematical induction that 𝑎3 − 𝑎 is divisible by 5, for all integer 𝑎 > 3. 
ChatGPT
To prove that 𝑎^3 - 𝑎 is divisible by 5 for all integers 𝑎 > 3, we will use mathematical induction.

Step 1: Base Case
Let's consider the base case where 𝑎 = 4. We have:
4^3 - 4 = 64 - 4 = 60.

Since 60 is divisible by 5 (60 = 5 * 12), the statement holds true for 𝑎 = 4.

Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis
Assume that for some integer 𝑘 > 3, 𝑘^3 - 𝑘 is divisible by 5. This is our inductive hypothesis.

Step 3: Inductive Step
We need to show that if the statement is true for 𝑘, then it is also true for 𝑘 + 1.

Let's consider 𝑘 + 1:
(𝑘 + 1)^3 - (𝑘 + 1) = 𝑘^3 + 3𝑘^2 + 3𝑘 + 1 - 𝑘 - 1 = 𝑘^3 + 3𝑘^2 + 2𝑘.

Using our inductive hypothesis, we know that 𝑘^3 - 𝑘 is divisible by 5. So, we can express 𝑘^3 - 𝑘 as 5𝑛 for some integer 𝑛.

(𝑘 + 1)^3 - (𝑘 + 1) = 𝑘^3 + 3𝑘^2 + 2𝑘 = (5𝑛 + 𝑘) + 3𝑘^2 + 2𝑘 = 5𝑛 + 3𝑘^2 + 3𝑘 = 5𝑛 + 3(𝑘^2 + 𝑘).

The term 3(𝑘^2 + 𝑘) is a multiple of 5 since it is the product of 3 and an integer 𝑘^2 + 𝑘. Therefore, (𝑘 + 1)^3 - (𝑘 + 1) is divisible by 5.

By mathematical induction, we have shown that 𝑎^3 - 𝑎 is divisible by 5 for all integers 𝑎 > 3.

67.	Show that  𝑛! ≤ 2𝑛, ∀ 𝑛 ≥ 1,  natural number
ChatGPT
To show that 𝑛! ≤ 2𝑛 for all 𝑛 ≥ 1, we will use mathematical induction.

Step 1: Base Case
Let's consider the base case where 𝑛 = 1. We have:
1! = 1 and 2𝑛 = 2.

Since 1 ≤ 2, the statement holds true for 𝑛 = 1.

Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis
Assume that for some natural number 𝑘 ≥ 1, 𝑘! ≤ 2𝑘. This is our inductive hypothesis.

Step 3: Inductive Step
We need to show that if the statement is true for 𝑘, then it is also true for 𝑘 + 1.

Let's consider 𝑘 + 1:
(𝑘 + 1)! = (𝑘 + 1)𝑘!

Using our inductive hypothesis, we know that 𝑘! ≤ 2𝑘. So, we can express 𝑘! as 2𝑘 or 𝑘! ≤ 2𝑘.

Multiplying both sides of the inequality by (𝑘 + 1), we have:
(𝑘 + 1)𝑘! ≤ (𝑘 + 1)(2𝑘).

Expanding the right side, we get:
(𝑘 + 1)𝑘! ≤ 2𝑘^2 + 2𝑘.

We can rewrite 2𝑘^2 + 2𝑘 as 2(𝑘^2 + 𝑘), which is clearly greater than or equal to (𝑘 + 1)(𝑘) for 𝑘 ≥ 1.

Therefore, we have:
(𝑘 + 1)𝑘! ≤ 2(𝑘^2 + 𝑘) ≤ 2(𝑘 + 1)(𝑘) = 2(𝑘 + 1)!.

By mathematical induction, we have shown that 𝑛! ≤ 2𝑛 for all 𝑛 ≥ 1.

68.	Show by PHP that atleast one number of the sequence 0.7, 0.77, 0.777, …, 0.7777….7, ….  is surely be divisible by 2023. 
ChatGPT
To show that at least one number in the sequence 0.7, 0.77, 0.777, ..., 0.7777....7, ... is divisible by 2023, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle.

Consider the remainders when each number in the sequence is divided by 2023. Since we have infinitely many numbers in the sequence, but only a finite number of possible remainders (2023 possible remainders), by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must exist two numbers in the sequence that have the same remainder when divided by 2023.

Let's assume we have two numbers in the sequence that have the same remainder when divided by 2023. Without loss of generality, let's say the numbers are of the form:

0.777...7 and 0.777...7 (with the same number of 7s)

Subtracting these two numbers, we get:

0.777...7 - 0.777...7 = 0.000...0 (with the same number of 0s)

This difference is equal to zero, which is divisible by any number, including 2023.

Therefore, at least one number in the sequence 0.7, 0.77, 0.777, ..., 0.7777....7, ... is surely divisible by 2023.

69.	A bag contains 10 red, 10 white and 10 blue balls. What is the minimum number of balls must draw randomly from the bag to ensure that 4 balls are of same color.  
ChatGPT
To ensure that at least 4 balls are of the same color, we can consider the worst-case scenario, where we draw the minimum number of balls required to guarantee this outcome.

Let's analyze each case individually:

Worst-case scenario for having 4 red balls:
In the worst-case scenario, we can draw 3 red balls, 3 white balls, and 3 blue balls. This gives us a total of 9 balls. However, if we draw 1 more ball, it is guaranteed that we will have at least 4 balls of the same color (red). Therefore, we need to draw a minimum of 9 + 1 = 10 balls.

Worst-case scenario for having 4 white balls:
Similarly, in the worst-case scenario, we can draw 3 red balls, 3 white balls, and 3 blue balls, totaling 9 balls. By drawing 1 more ball, we are ensured to have at least 4 balls of the same color (white). Thus, we need to draw a minimum of 9 + 1 = 10 balls.

Worst-case scenario for having 4 blue balls:
Again, in the worst-case scenario, we draw 3 red balls, 3 white balls, and 3 blue balls, giving us a total of 9 balls. Drawing 1 additional ball guarantees that we will have at least 4 balls of the same color (blue). Hence, we need to draw a minimum of 9 + 1 = 10 balls.

Therefore, in order to ensure that at least 4 balls are of the same color, we must draw a minimum of 10 balls from the bag.

70.	How many integers between 1 to 1000 inclusive, do not share a common factor with 1000.  
ChatGPT
To determine the number of integers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) that do not share a common factor with 1000, we need to find the count of integers that are relatively prime to 1000.

We can use Euler's totient function (φ-function) to calculate the count of relatively prime numbers. The formula for φ-function states that for any positive integer 𝑛, the count of positive integers less than or equal to 𝑛 and relatively prime to 𝑛 is given by:

φ(𝑛) = 𝑛 * (1 - 1/𝑝₁) * (1 - 1/𝑝₂) * ... * (1 - 1/𝑝𝑘),

where 𝑝₁, 𝑝₂, ..., 𝑝𝑘 are the distinct prime factors of 𝑛.

In the case of 1000, the prime factorization is 2^3 * 5^3. Therefore, we have:

φ(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 400.

So, there are 400 integers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) that do not share a common factor with 1000.

71.	Show that there are binary sequence containing exactly p 0’s and q 1’s with q ≥ p – 1, with no two zeros together is   
ChatGPT
To show that there are binary sequences containing exactly p 0's and q 1's, where q ≥ p - 1, with no two zeros together, we can use a combinatorial argument.

Consider a binary sequence of length p + q where we need to place p 0's and q 1's with the condition that no two zeros are together. Let's denote 0 as 'O' and 1 as 'I' to differentiate between the two elements.

We will construct such a sequence by considering the following steps:

Step 1: Place all the q 1's first. Since q ≥ p - 1, we have enough 1's to place. We can represent this as the sequence 'II...I' where there are q 1's.

Step 2: Now, we have p + q - q = p 0's left to place. We will insert these zeros among the q 1's in such a way that no two zeros are together.

To achieve this, we will consider the q 1's as positions where we can insert the p 0's. Since there are q 1's and p 0's, we can think of this as placing the p 0's in the q + 1 available positions (including the edges).

Using the stars and bars combinatorial argument, we can determine that the number of ways to place p 0's among q + 1 positions without any two zeros together is given by (q + 1 - p) choose p.

This means that there are (q + 1 - p) choose p ways to construct such a binary sequence.

Therefore, we have shown that there are binary sequences containing exactly p 0's and q 1's, where q ≥ p - 1, with no two zeros together.

ChatGPT
To prove that the argument 𝑝 ⟶ ~𝑞, 𝑟 ⟶ 𝑞, 𝑟 ⊢ ~𝑝 is a valid statement, we can demonstrate its validity using logical deductions.

Assume 𝑝 as the premise.
By modus ponens, from 𝑝 and 𝑝 ⟶ ~𝑞, we can deduce ~𝑞.
Assume 𝑟 as the premise.
By modus ponens, from 𝑟 and 𝑟 ⟶ 𝑞, we can deduce 𝑞.
We have ~𝑞 from step 2 and 𝑞 from step 4.
From steps 5 and 1, we can apply reductio ad absurdum to derive ~𝑝, which is the negation of the assumption 𝑝.
Therefore, we have shown that assuming 𝑝, 𝑟, 𝑝 ⟶ ~𝑞, and 𝑟 ⟶ 𝑞 lead to the conclusion ~𝑝. Thus, the argument 𝑝 ⟶ ~𝑞, 𝑟 ⟶ 𝑞, 𝑟 ⊢ ~𝑝 is valid.

ChatGPT
To show that the argument 𝑝 ⟶ 𝑞, ~𝑝 ⊢ ~𝑞 is a fallacy, we can provide a counterexample that demonstrates its invalidity.

Let's consider the following values for 𝑝 and 𝑞:

𝑝: It is true.
𝑞: It is false.

Using these values, we can evaluate the premises and the conclusion of the argument:

𝑝 ⟶ 𝑞: Since 𝑝 is true and 𝑞 is false, the statement 𝑝 ⟶ 𝑞 is false.
~𝑝: Since 𝑝 is true, ~𝑝 is false.
~𝑞: According to the conclusion, ~𝑞 should be true.
However, in our chosen example, ~𝑞 is false since 𝑞 is false.

Therefore, we have found a specific case where the premises 𝑝 ⟶ 𝑞 and ~𝑝 are true, but the conclusion ~𝑞 is false. This demonstrates that the argument 𝑝 ⟶ 𝑞, ~𝑝 ⊢ ~𝑞 is invalid, making it a fallacy.

. Construct the truth table of {(𝑝 ∧ ~𝑞) → 𝑟} ⟶ {𝑝 ⟶ (𝑞 ∨ 𝑟).  
ChatGPT
To construct the truth table for the statement {(𝑝 ∧ ~𝑞) → 𝑟} ⟶ {𝑝 ⟶ (𝑞 ∨ 𝑟)}, we need to consider all possible combinations of truth values for the variables 𝑝, 𝑞, and 𝑟.

Let's create a truth table with columns for 𝑝, 𝑞, 𝑟, (𝑝 ∧ ~𝑞), (𝑝 ∧ ~𝑞) → 𝑟, 𝑝 ⟶ (𝑞 ∨ 𝑟), and the final implication {(𝑝 ∧ ~𝑞) → 𝑟} ⟶ {𝑝 ⟶ (𝑞 ∨ 𝑟)}.

Here's the truth table:

𝑝	𝑞	𝑟	(𝑝 ∧ ~𝑞)	(𝑝 ∧ ~𝑞) → 𝑟	𝑝 ⟶ (𝑞 ∨ 𝑟)	{(𝑝 ∧ ~𝑞) → 𝑟} ⟶ {𝑝 ⟶ (𝑞 ∨ 𝑟)}
T	T	T	F	T	T	T
T	T	F	F	T	T	T

F	T	T	F	T	T	T
F	T	F	F	T	T	T
F	F	T	F	T	T	T
F	F	F	F	T	T	T
In the truth table, T represents true, and F represents false. By evaluating the statement for all possible combinations of truth values, we can see that the final implication {(𝑝 ∧ ~𝑞) → 𝑟} ⟶ {𝑝 ⟶ (𝑞 ∨ 𝑟)} is always true. Therefore, the statement is a tautology, meaning it is true for all possible truth value assignments.

Let's create a truth table with columns for 𝑝, 𝑞, ¬(¬𝑝 ⋀ 𝑞), ¬(¬𝑝 ⋀ 𝑞) ⋁ 𝑞, 𝑝 ⋁ 𝑞, and check if the two statements always have the same truth value.

Here's the truth table:

𝑝	𝑞	¬(¬𝑝 ⋀ 𝑞)	¬(¬𝑝 ⋀ 𝑞) ⋁ 𝑞	𝑝 ⋁ 𝑞
T	T	T	T	T
T	F	F	F	T
F	T	T	T	T
F	F	T	T	F
In the truth table, T represents true and F represents false.

By comparing the truth values of ¬(¬𝑝 ⋀ 𝑞) ⋁ 𝑞 and 𝑝 ⋁ 𝑞, we can observe that the two statements have the same truth values for all possible combinations of truth values for 𝑝 and 𝑞. Therefore, we can conclude that the two logical statements ¬(¬𝑝 ⋀ 𝑞) ⋁ 𝑞 and 𝑝 ⋁ 𝑞 are equivalent.

77.	Find the solution of 5𝑥 ≡ 14 (𝑚𝑜𝑑 24). 
ChatGPT
To find the solution of the congruence equation 5𝑥 ≡ 14 (mod 24), we need to find an integer 𝑥 that satisfies the equation.

First, let's find the modular inverse of 5 modulo 24. The modular inverse of 5 (mod 24) is 5 itself since 5 * 5 ≡ 1 (mod 24).

Now, we can multiply both sides of the congruence equation by the modular inverse of 5:

5𝑥 * 5 ≡ 14 * 5 (mod 24)
25𝑥 ≡ 70 (mod 24)

Since 25 ≡ 1 (mod 24), we have:

𝑥 ≡ 70 * 1 (mod 24)
𝑥 ≡ 70 (mod 24)

To find the smallest non-negative solution, we can reduce 70 modulo 24:

𝑥 ≡ 70 % 24
𝑥 ≡ 22 (mod 24)

Therefore, the solution to the congruence equation 5𝑥 ≡ 14 (mod 24) is 𝑥 ≡ 22 (mod 24).

To show that the expression ((𝑝 ∨ 𝑞) ∧∼ (∼ 𝑝 ∧ (∼ 𝑞 ∨∼ 𝑟))) ∨ (∼ 𝑝 ∧∼ 𝑞) ∨ (∼ 𝑝 ∧∼ 𝑟) is a tautology, we can construct a truth table and verify that the expression evaluates to true for all possible truth value assignments to 𝑝, 𝑞, and 𝑟.

Here's the truth table:

𝑝	𝑞	𝑟	(𝑝 ∨ 𝑞)	(∼𝑝 ∧ (∼𝑞 ∨ ∼𝑟))	((𝑝 ∨ 𝑞) ∧ ∼(∼𝑝 ∧ (∼𝑞 ∨ ∼𝑟)))	(∼𝑝 ∧ ∼𝑞)	(∼𝑝 ∧ ∼𝑟)	(((𝑝 ∨ 𝑞) ∧ ∼(∼𝑝 ∧ (∼𝑞 ∨ ∼𝑟))) ∨ (∼𝑝 ∧ ∼𝑞) ∨ (∼𝑝 ∧ ∼𝑟))

F	F	T	F	T	F	T	F	T
F	F	F	F	T	F	T	T	T
In the truth table, T represents true and F represents false.

By evaluating the expression for all possible combinations of truth values for 𝑝, 𝑞, and 𝑟, we can see that the expression (((𝑝 ∨ 𝑞) ∧ ∼(∼𝑝 ∧ (∼𝑞 ∨ ∼𝑟))) ∨ (∼𝑝 ∧ ∼𝑞) ∨ (∼𝑝 ∧ ∼𝑟)) always evaluates to true. Therefore, the expression is a tautology.

79.	Using Euclidean Algorithm, find the solution of Diophantine Equation: 243x + 315y = 9. 
ChatGPT
To solve the Diophantine equation 243𝑥 + 315𝑦 = 9 using the Euclidean algorithm, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 243 and 315.

Step 1: Apply the Euclidean algorithm
Divide 315 by 243:
315 = 243 × 1 + 72

Step 2: Repeat the process with the previous divisor and the remainder
Divide 243 by 72:
243 = 72 × 3 + 27

Step 3: Repeat the process again
Divide 72 by 27:
72 = 27 × 2 + 18

Step 4: Repeat once more
Divide 27 by 18:
27 = 18 × 1 + 9

Step 5: Final step
Divide 18 by 9:
18 = 9 × 2 + 0

The final non-zero remainder we obtain is 9. Therefore, the GCD of 243 and 315 is 9.

Step 6: Express the GCD as a linear combination
Working backward, we can express the GCD of 9 as a linear combination of 243 and 315:
9 = 27 - 18
= 27 - (72 - 27 × 2)
= 27 × 3 - 72
= (243 - 72 × 3) × 3 - 72
= 243 × 3 - 72 × 9
= 243 × 3 + 315 × (-3)

From this, we can see that 𝑥 = 3 and 𝑦 = -3 satisfy the Diophantine equation 243𝑥 + 315𝑦 = 9.

ChatGPT
A group homomorphism is a function between two groups that preserves the group operation. More formally, let (𝐺, ⋆) and (𝐻, ∘) be two groups. A function 𝑓: 𝐺 → 𝐻 is called a group homomorphism if it satisfies the following property:

For all elements 𝑎, 𝑏 in 𝐺, 𝑓(𝑎 ⋆ 𝑏) = 𝑓(𝑎) ∘ 𝑓(𝑏).

Now let's test if 𝑓: (ℝ, +) → (ℝ⁺, ×) defined by 𝑓(𝑥) = 2𝑥 is a group homomorphism.

For any 𝑎, 𝑏 in ℝ, we need to check if 𝑓(𝑎 + 𝑏) = 𝑓(𝑎) × 𝑓(𝑏).

Let's compute 𝑓(𝑎 + 𝑏):
𝑓(𝑎 + 𝑏) = 2(𝑎 + 𝑏) = 2𝑎 + 2𝑏

Now let's compute 𝑓(𝑎) × 𝑓(𝑏):
𝑓(𝑎) × 𝑓(𝑏) = (2𝑎) × (2𝑏) = 4𝑎𝑏

We can observe that 𝑓(𝑎 + 𝑏) = 2𝑎 + 2𝑏 and 𝑓(𝑎) × 𝑓(𝑏) = 4𝑎𝑏 are not equal for all 𝑎 and 𝑏 in ℝ. Therefore, 𝑓(𝑥) = 2𝑥 is not a group homomorphism from (ℝ, +) to (ℝ⁺, ×).

83.	Define Planar graph. Illustrate the dual of a planar graph. What is the minimum number of edges necessary in a simple planar graph with 15 regions? 
ChatGPT
A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn on a plane (or a flat surface) in such a way that no edges intersect except at their endpoints. In other words, a planar graph is a graph that can be represented without any edges crossing.

The dual of a planar graph is obtained by assigning a vertex to each face or region of the original planar graph, and connecting two vertices in the dual if the corresponding regions share an edge in the original graph. In other words, the dual graph has a vertex for each region and an edge between two vertices if the corresponding regions share a common edge.

To determine the minimum number of edges necessary in a simple planar graph with 15 regions, we can use Euler's formula, which states that for a connected planar graph with V vertices, E edges, and F faces (including the outer face), the following relationship holds:

V - E + F = 2.

In this case, we have F = 15 (15 regions). Let's assume the graph is connected, so V is equal to the number of vertices in the graph.

Using Euler's formula, we can rearrange the equation to solve for E:

E = V + F - 2.

Since we want to minimize the number of edges, we want to minimize E. This occurs when the graph is a tree (a connected acyclic graph), which has the minimum number of edges for a given number of vertices.

For a tree with V vertices, the number of edges is V - 1. Therefore, in a simple planar graph with 15 regions, the minimum number of edges necessary is 15 - 1 = 14.

85.	The chromatic polynomial of the cycle of size n is (𝑥 − 1)𝑛 + (−1)𝑛(𝑥 − 1). 
 
ChatGPT
The statement you provided is incorrect. The correct chromatic polynomial of a cycle of size n is:

𝑃(𝑥) = 𝑥(𝑥 − 1)^(n-1)

Let's break down the reasoning behind this formula.

In a cycle of size n, each vertex is connected to two adjacent vertices, forming a circular structure. To assign colors to the vertices in such a way that no adjacent vertices have the same color, we start by assigning any color to the first vertex. Then, for each subsequent vertex, we have (𝑥 - 1) choices for the color, as we cannot use the same color as its adjacent vertex. Therefore, the chromatic polynomial is 𝑥(𝑥 - 1)^(n-1).

Let's illustrate this with an example:

For a cycle of size 3 (a triangle), the chromatic polynomial is 𝑥(𝑥 - 1)^(3-1) = 𝑥(𝑥 - 1)^2 = 𝑥(𝑥^2 - 2𝑥 + 1) = 𝑥^3 - 2𝑥^2 + 𝑥.

For a cycle of size 4 (a square), the chromatic polynomial is 𝑥(𝑥 - 1)^(4-1) = 𝑥(𝑥 - 1)^3 = 𝑥(𝑥^3 - 3𝑥^2 + 3𝑥 - 1) = 𝑥^4 - 3𝑥^3 + 3𝑥^2 - 𝑥.

You can see that the correct chromatic polynomial follows the pattern of 𝑥^n - (n-1)𝑥^(n-1) + ... + (-1)^(n-1)𝑥, with alternating signs for each term except the first one.

87.	(i) The identity element in G is unique.    (ii) (𝑎−1)−1 = 𝑎 .  
ChatGPT
(i) To prove that the identity element in a group G is unique, we need to show that there cannot be two distinct identity elements in G.

Let's assume that G is a group and suppose there exist two distinct identity elements, denoted as e and e'. We want to show that e and e' are actually the same element.

By definition, the identity element e satisfies the property that for any element a in G, ae = ea = a. Similarly, the identity element e' satisfies the same property.

Now, let's consider the product e'e. Since e is an identity element, we have e'e = e. However, since e' is also an identity element, we have e'e = e'. Therefore, we have e = e', which means that the assumed distinct identity elements e and e' are actually the same element.

Hence, we have proved that the identity element in G is unique.

(ii) To prove that (a^(-1))^(-1) = a for any element a in a group G, we need to show that the inverse of the inverse of a is equal to a.

Let's consider an element a in G and its inverse, denoted as a^(-1). By definition, a^(-1) is the unique element in G such that a * a^(-1) = a^(-1) * a = e, where e is the identity element in G.

Now, let's consider the inverse of a^(-1), which is (a^(-1))^(-1). By definition, (a^(-1))^(-1) is the unique element in G such that a^(-1) * (a^(-1))^(-1) = (a^(-1))^(-1) * a^(-1) = e.

We want to show that (a^(-1))^(-1) = a. Let's multiply both sides of the equation a * a^(-1) = e by a^(-1):

a * a^(-1) * a^(-1) = e * a^(-1)
a * (a^(-1) * a^(-1)) = a^(-1)
a * (a^(-1))^(-1) = a^(-1)

Since a * (a^(-1))^(-1) = a^(-1) and a^(-1) * (a^(-1))^(-1) = e, we can conclude that (a^(-1))^(-1) = a.

Therefore, we have proved that (a^(-1))^(-1) = a for any element a in a group G.

88.	Prove that for any tree G = (V, E), |E| = |V| - 1. 
ChatGPT
To prove that for any tree G = (V, E), the number of edges |E| is equal to the number of vertices |V| minus 1, we can use the concept of tree properties.

A tree is defined as an undirected connected acyclic graph. Let's assume G is a tree with |V| vertices and |E| edges.

First, we will show that if G is a tree, then it is acyclic. Since a tree is defined as an acyclic graph, this property holds by definition.

Next, we will prove that if G is a tree, then it is connected. A tree is a connected graph, which means there is a path between any two vertices in the graph. If G is not connected, there would be at least two disjoint components, and it would not satisfy the definition of a tree. Therefore, G must be connected.

Now, let's use the concept of a spanning tree. A spanning tree of a connected graph is a subgraph that contains all the vertices of the original graph and is itself a tree. In other words, a spanning tree of G is a tree that includes all the vertices of G.

A spanning tree of G will have |V| - 1 edges. This is because, in a tree, the number of edges is always one less than the number of vertices. Every edge added to a tree creates a new vertex, and hence the number of edges is incremented by one.

Since G is a tree, any subgraph of G, including a spanning tree, will have |V| - 1 edges. Therefore, |E| = |V| - 1 for any tree G.

Hence, we have proved that for any tree G = (V, E), the number of edges |E| is equal to the number of vertices |V| minus 1.

89.	Show that (ℝ , +, *) is a field. Is it an integral domain – Justify. 
ChatGPT
To show that (ℝ, +, *) is a field, we need to demonstrate that it satisfies the properties of a field: addition and multiplication are well-defined operations, it is closed under addition and multiplication, it has an identity element for both operations, every element has an additive inverse, and every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.

Addition and multiplication: In ℝ, addition (+) and multiplication (*) are well-defined operations. Adding or multiplying any two real numbers always yields a real number.

Closure under addition and multiplication: For any two real numbers a and b, the sum a + b and the product a * b are both real numbers. Therefore, ℝ is closed under addition and multiplication.

Identity elements: The identity element for addition in ℝ is 0, as for any real number a, a + 0 = 0 + a = a. The identity element for multiplication in ℝ is 1, as for any real number a, a * 1 = 1 * a = a.

Additive inverses: For every real number a, there exists an additive inverse (-a) such that a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0. This means that every element in ℝ has an additive inverse.

Multiplicative inverses: For every non-zero real number a, there exists a multiplicative inverse (1/a) such that a * (1/a) = (1/a) * a = 1. This means that every non-zero element in ℝ has a multiplicative inverse.

Therefore, (ℝ, +, *) satisfies all the properties of a field.

Now, let's discuss whether (ℝ, +, *) is an integral domain. An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity where no zero divisors exist. In other words, in an integral domain, if a * b = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0.

(ℝ, +, *) is not an integral domain because it does have zero divisors. For example, consider the real numbers a = 0 and b = 2. Although a * b = 0, where a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0, we have a non-zero element b such that the product a * b is zero.

Therefore, (ℝ, +, *) is a field but not an integral domain.

90.	Define Planar graph. Illustrate the dual of a planar graph. What is the minimum number of edges necessary in a simple planar graph with 15 regions? 
ChatGPT
A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn on a plane without any of its edges crossing each other. In other words, it is a graph that can be represented without any edge intersections.

The dual of a planar graph is a graph obtained by assigning a vertex to each face (region) of the original planar graph and connecting two vertices if their corresponding faces share an edge. The dual graph provides a different representation of the relationships between regions in the original graph.

To determine the minimum number of edges necessary in a simple planar graph with 15 regions, we can make use of Euler's formula for planar graphs. Euler's formula states that for a connected planar graph with V vertices, E edges, and F faces (regions), the following equation holds:

V - E + F = 2

In this case, we have F = 15 (15 regions) and we want to find the minimum number of edges (E). Since the graph is simple, each edge is shared by two regions. So, the total number of edges is given by E = (2 * F)/2 = F.

Substituting F = 15 into the equation, we get:

V - E + 15 = 2

Rearranging the equation, we have:

E = V + 13

To minimize the number of edges (E), we need to minimize the number of vertices (V). In a simple planar graph, the minimum number of vertices required is 3, as a planar graph with fewer than 3 vertices cannot form any regions. Therefore, the minimum number of edges necessary in a simple planar graph with 15 regions is:

E = 3 + 13 = 16

Hence, a simple planar graph with 15 regions must have a minimum of 16 edges.

To compute 52022 modulo 17, we need to find the remainder when 52022 is divided by 17.

52022 divided by 17 is equal to 3060 with a remainder of 2. This means that 52022 can be expressed as 17 times 3060 plus 2.

Therefore, the remainder when 52022 is divided by 17 is 2.

Hence, 52022 modulo 17 is equal to 2.

92.	Show that,   is a group. Is it a cyclic group – Justify. 
ChatGPT
To determine if the set G = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} with the operation * defined as a * b = a + b - 6 is a group, we need to verify four conditions: closure, associativity, existence of an identity element, and existence of inverses.

Closure: For any two elements a and b in G, a * b = a + b - 6. Since the sum of two elements from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is always in the range [2, 9], and subtracting 6 from this range gives us {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, we see that a * b is always an element in G. Therefore, closure is satisfied.

Associativity: Since addition is associative, the operation * is also associative. For any three elements a, b, and c in G, (a * b) * c = (a + b - 6) + c - 6 = a + (b + c) - 12 = a + (b + c - 6) - 6 = a * (b * c). Hence, associativity is satisfied.

Identity element: An identity element e in a group satisfies the property a * e = a = e * a for all elements a in the group. In G, we can observe that 3 is the identity element. For any element a in G, a * 3 = a + 3 - 6 = a. Also, 3 * a = 3 + a - 6 = a. Thus, the identity element 3 exists in G.

Inverses: Every element in G has an inverse. For any element a in G, its inverse is given by (6 - a). This is because a * (6 - a) = a + (6 - a) - 6 = 6 - 6 = 0, which is the identity element. Similarly, (6 - a) * a = (6 - a) + a - 6 = 6 - 6 = 0. Thus, every element in G has an inverse.

Therefore, G = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} with the operation * defined as a + b - 6 is a group.

Now, let's determine if G is a cyclic group. A group G is cyclic if there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be expressed as a power of g. In other words, G is cyclic if there is a generator for G.

In this case, we can see that there is no single element in G that can generate all other elements. For example, if we start with the element 1 and apply the operation * repeatedly, we can generate the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, but we cannot generate 6 or any other element larger than 5. Similarly, starting with any other element does not generate all the elements of G.

Therefore, G = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} with the operation * is not a cyclic group since there is no generator for the group.

P: Surojit solve this problem.

The argument can be represented as follows:

T	T	T	T	T
T	F	F	F	T
F	T	T	T	F
F	F	T	F	F
From the truth table, we can see that whenever the premises (If P, then Q and Q) are both true, the conclusion (P) is also true. Therefore, the argument is valid.

In other words, if Surojit solves the problem (P), and Surojit scores 90 (Q), then it follows that Surojit indeed solves the problem (P).

ChatGPT
To show that there are binary sequences containing exactly q 0's and p 1's with p ≥ q - 1, and no two zeros are together, we can use combinatorial reasoning.

Consider the following approach:

Start with a sequence of p 1's: 1111...1 (p times).

Now we have p + 1 gaps between the 1's where the 0's can be placed. We need to distribute q 0's in these gaps such that no two zeros are together.

Since no two zeros can be together, we can place at most one zero in each gap. This means that out of p + 1 gaps, we need to select q gaps to place the zeros.

The number of ways to select q gaps out of p + 1 gaps is given by the binomial coefficient (p+1)Cq.

Therefore, the total number of binary sequences satisfying the given conditions is (p+1)Cq.

Now let's check the condition p ≥ q - 1:

If p ≥ q - 1, then p + 1 ≥ q.

Therefore, (p+1)Cq is defined and represents the number of ways to select q gaps out of p + 1 gaps.

Hence, there are binary sequences containing exactly q 0's and p 1's with p ≥ q - 1, and no two zeros are together.

96.	Show that a cycle with n vertices is not perfect if n is odd and greater than 3.  
ChatGPT
To show that a cycle with n vertices is not perfect if n is odd and greater than 3, we need to demonstrate the existence of an odd cycle in the complement of the given cycle.

A perfect graph is defined as a graph in which the size of the largest clique is equal to the chromatic number. In other words, a graph is perfect if and only if its complement is also perfect.

Consider a cycle with n vertices, denoted as C_n. If n is odd and greater than 3, then n is at least 5.

Now, let's consider the complement of C_n. The complement of C_n will be a graph with the same set of vertices, where two vertices are adjacent in the complement if and only if they are not adjacent in C_n.

Since C_n is a cycle, every vertex is adjacent to exactly two other vertices. In the complement, this means that every vertex is not adjacent to exactly two other vertices.

Now, let's consider the subgraph of the complement induced by these vertices that are not adjacent to each other. This subgraph is an odd cycle with at least 5 vertices because we have at least 5 vertices that are pairwise non-adjacent.

Since an odd cycle is not perfect (its chromatic number is 3 and it does not have a clique of size 3), it follows that the complement of C_n is not perfect.

Therefore, the cycle C_n with n vertices is not perfect if n is odd and greater than 3.

97.	If a graph G has at least one edge then the sum of the coefficients in its chromatic  polynomial is 
0.  
ChatGPT
The chromatic polynomial of a graph G is a polynomial that counts the number of proper vertex colorings of G using a given number of colors.

Let's assume that G is a graph with at least one edge. The chromatic polynomial of G is given by:

P(G, x) = x(x-1)^(n-1)

where n is the number of vertices in G.

To find the sum of the coefficients in the chromatic polynomial, we substitute x = 1 into the polynomial and evaluate it:

P(G, 1) = 1(1-1)^(n-1) = 0^(n-1) = 0

Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the chromatic polynomial is 0 when G has at least one edge.

98.	Show that (ℤ5, +5) forms a field under addition and multiplication modulo class.  
ChatGPT
To show that (ℤ5, +5) forms a field under addition and multiplication modulo class, we need to demonstrate that the following properties hold:

Closure: For any a, b ∈ ℤ5, the sum a +5 b and product a ×5 b are also in ℤ5.

Associativity: Addition and multiplication in ℤ5 are associative operations. That is, for any a, b, and c ∈ ℤ5, (a +5 b) +5 c = a +5 (b +5 c) and (a ×5 b) ×5 c = a ×5 (b ×5 c).

Identity elements: There exist additive and multiplicative identity elements in ℤ5. The additive identity is 0, and the multiplicative identity is 1.

Inverse elements: For every element a ∈ ℤ5, there exists an additive inverse (-a) and a multiplicative inverse (if a ≠ 0) such that a +5 (-a) = 0 and a ×5 a^(-1) = 1.

Commutativity: Addition and multiplication in ℤ5 are commutative operations. That is, for any a and b ∈ ℤ5, a +5 b = b +5 a and a ×5 b = b ×5 a.

Let's verify each of these properties:

Closure: Since ℤ5 consists of the elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, adding or multiplying any two elements will result in another element in ℤ5. Therefore, closure holds.

Associativity: Addition and multiplication are associative operations in ℤ5 as they are modulo operations. Hence, associativity holds.

Identity elements: The additive identity is 0, as 0 +5 a = a +5 0 = a for any a ∈ ℤ5. The multiplicative identity is 1, as 1 ×5 a = a ×5 1 = a for any a ∈ ℤ5. Therefore, identity elements exist.

Inverse elements: For every element a ∈ ℤ5, the additive inverse is (-a), where a +5 (-a) = (-a) +5 a = 0. The multiplicative inverse exists for every non-zero element a ∈ ℤ5. For example, the multiplicative inverse of 1 is 1, as 1 ×5 1 = 1. Similarly, the multiplicative inverse of 2 is 3, as 2 ×5 3 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Therefore, inverse elements exist.

Commutativity: Addition and multiplication are commutative operations in ℤ5. For any a and b ∈ ℤ5, a +5 b = b +5 a and a ×5 b = b ×5 a. Thus, commutativity holds.

Since all the required properties are satisfied, we can conclude that (ℤ5, +5) forms a field under addition and multiplication modulo class.

Lagrange's theorem states that for any finite group G, the order of any subgroup H of G divides the order of G. Mathematically, if G is a finite group and H is a subgroup of G, then |H| divides |G|, where |H| denotes the order of the subgroup H, and |G| denotes the order of the group G.

Now, let's establish by an example that every divisor of a finite group may not have a subgroup of that order.

Consider the symmetric group S3, which consists of all permutations of three elements {1, 2, 3}. The order of S3 is 3! = 6.

Divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

Now, let's see if there exist subgroups of S3 with orders 1, 2, 3, and 6:

Subgroup of order 1: The subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element, has order 1. This subgroup exists.

Subgroup of order 2: There is no subgroup of order 2 in S3. The only elements of order 2 in S3 are (1 2) and (2 3), but they do not generate a subgroup of order 2.

Subgroup of order 3: The subgroup generated by the element (1 2 3) has order 3. This subgroup exists.

Subgroup of order 6: The entire group S3 is the only subgroup of order 6. In this case, the divisor 6 does have a subgroup of order 6.

From this example, we can see that not every divisor of a finite group has a subgroup of that order. In the case of S3, there is no subgroup of order 2, even though 2 is a divisor of the group's order.

100.	Show that (𝑆3, 𝑜) is a non-abelian group of permutation of 3 elements. 
ChatGPT
To show that (S3, o) is a non-abelian group of permutations of 3 elements, we need to demonstrate two things:

The operation o (composition) is well-defined and associative.
The group (S3, o) is non-abelian, meaning there exist permutations in S3 that do not commute under the operation o.
Let's prove these two points:

Associativity:
To show that the operation o is associative, we need to verify that for any permutations a, b, and c in S3, (a o b) o c = a o (b o c).
Let's take three arbitrary permutations in S3:

a = (a1 a2 a3)
b = (b1 b2 b3)
c = (c1 c2 c3)

Now, let's compute (a o b) o c:

(a o b) o c = ((a1 a2 a3) o (b1 b2 b3)) o (c1 c2 c3)

By applying the composition operation o, we get:

(a o b) o c = (a1 a2 a3)(b1 b2 b3)(c1 c2 c3)

Next, let's compute a o (b o c):

a o (b o c) = (a1 a2 a3) o ((b1 b2 b3) o (c1 c2 c3))

Again, by applying the composition operation o, we get:

a o (b o c) = (a1 a2 a3)((b1 b2 b3)(c1 c2 c3))

If we evaluate both expressions, we will find that they yield the same result. Therefore, the operation o is associative in S3.

Non-abelian Property:
To show that (S3, o) is non-abelian, we need to find two permutations a and b in S3 such that a o b is not equal to b o a.
Let's consider the permutations:

a = (1 2 3)
b = (1 3 2)

If we compute a o b and b o a, we get:

a o b = (1 2 3)(1 3 2) = (1 3)(2)
b o a = (1 3 2)(1 2 3) = (2 3)(1)

We can observe that (1 3)(2) is not equal to (2 3)(1). Therefore, a o b is not equal to b o a.

Since we have shown that the operation o is well-defined, associative, and (S3, o) is non-abelian, we can conclude that (S3, o) is a non-abelian group of permutations of 3 elements.

101.	Prove that a group G is an abelian if and only if, for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1 hold.  
ChatGPT
To prove that a group G is abelian if and only if, for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1 holds, we need to show two implications:

If G is abelian, then for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1.
If for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1 holds, then G is abelian.
Let's prove each implication:

If G is abelian, then for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1.
Assume G is an abelian group. Let 𝑎, 𝑏 be arbitrary elements of G.

We want to show that (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1.

Using the property of inverses in a group, we have:

(𝑎𝑏)−1 = (𝑏−1𝑎−1) [Multiplying both sides by 𝑏−1𝑎−1]

Since G is abelian, we know that 𝑎𝑏 = 𝑏𝑎. Therefore:

(𝑎𝑏)−1 = (𝑏𝑎)−1

Now, applying the property of inverses again, we have:

(𝑏𝑎)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1

Hence, we have shown that for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1.

If for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1 holds, then G is abelian.
Assume that for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1 holds.

To prove that G is abelian, we need to show that for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, 𝑎𝑏 = 𝑏𝑎.

Let 𝑎, 𝑏 be arbitrary elements of G.

Consider the product (𝑎𝑏)−1:

(𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1 [Using the given condition]

Now, take the inverse of both sides:

((𝑎𝑏)−1)−1 = (𝑎−1𝑏−1)−1

𝑎𝑏 = 𝑏𝑎

Hence, we have shown that for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, 𝑎𝑏 = 𝑏𝑎, which implies that G is abelian.

Therefore, we have proven both implications, and we can conclude that a group G is abelian if and only if, for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, (𝑎𝑏)−1 = 𝑎−1𝑏−1 holds

102.	Prove that every finite integral domain is a field. 
ChatGPT
To prove that every finite integral domain is a field, we need to show that every non-zero element in the integral domain has a multiplicative inverse.

Let D be a finite integral domain and let a be a non-zero element in D. We want to show that a has a multiplicative inverse.

Since D is an integral domain, every non-zero element is cancellable. This means that if a⋅b = a⋅c for non-zero elements a, b, and c, then b = c.

Consider the set {a⋅k | k ∈ D}. Since D is finite, this set is also finite.

Since D is a finite integral domain, there are no zero divisors, which means that no two distinct elements in D can have the same product with a. In other words, for any two distinct elements k₁, k₂ ∈ D, if a⋅k₁ = a⋅k₂, then k₁ = k₂.

Therefore, each element in the set {a⋅k | k ∈ D} is distinct.

Since D is finite, there must exist k₁, k₂ ∈ D such that a⋅k₁ = a⋅k₂ and k₁ ≠ k₂.

Using the cancellability property of integral domains, we can cancel a from both sides of the equation to get k₁ = k₂.

This contradicts our assumption that k₁ and k₂ are distinct.

Hence, it must be the case that for every element k in D, a⋅k is unique.

Now, consider the set {a⋅k | k ∈ D}. Since each element a⋅k is unique, and D is finite, this set contains all non-zero elements of D.

Since the set contains all non-zero elements, there must exist an element k' ∈ D such that a⋅k' = 1 (the multiplicative identity).

Therefore, every non-zero element in D has a multiplicative inverse, and D is a field.

Hence, we have proven that every finite integral domain is a field.

103.	Find the all cosets of 𝐻 = {±1, ±𝑖} in group 𝐺 = {±1, ±𝑖, ±𝑗, ±𝑘} with respect to  multiplication as operation.  
ChatGPT
To find all the cosets of the subgroup H = {±1, ±𝑖} in the group G = {±1, ±𝑖, ±𝑗, ±𝑘} with respect to multiplication as the operation, we need to determine the left cosets of H in G.

The left coset of H in G is given by the set gH = {gh | h ∈ H}, where g is an element of G.

Let's determine the left cosets:

For g = ±1:
gH = {±1h | h ∈ H} = {±1, ±𝑖}

For g = ±𝑖:
gH = {±𝑖h | h ∈ H} = {±𝑖, ±𝑖²} = {±𝑖, ±1}

For g = ±𝑗:
gH = {±𝑗h | h ∈ H} = {±𝑗h | h ∈ {±1, ±𝑖}} = {±𝑗, ±𝑗𝑖, ±𝑗(−1), ±𝑗(−𝑖)} = {±𝑗, ±𝑘, ±(−𝑗), ±(−𝑘)}

For g = ±𝑘:
gH = {±𝑘h | h ∈ H} = {±𝑘h | h ∈ {±1, ±𝑖}} = {±𝑘, ±𝑘𝑖, ±(−𝑘), ±(−𝑘𝑖)} = {±𝑘, ±𝑗, ±(−𝑘), ±(−𝑗)}

So, the cosets of H in G are:
H = {±1, ±𝑖}
𝑖H = {±𝑖, ±1}
𝑗H = {±𝑗, ±𝑘, ±(−𝑗), ±(−𝑘)}
𝑘H = {±𝑘, ±𝑗, ±(−𝑘), ±(−𝑗)}

These are the four distinct left cosets of H in G with respect to multiplication as the operation.

104.	Show that the proposition 𝑝 ⋁ ~(𝑝 ∧ 𝑞) is a tautology
ChatGPT
To show that the proposition 𝑝 ⋁ ~(𝑝 ∧ 𝑞) is a tautology, we need to demonstrate that it is always true regardless of the truth values of 𝑝 and 𝑞.

We can construct a truth table to evaluate the proposition for all possible combinations of truth values for 𝑝 and 𝑞:

𝑝	𝑞	𝑝 ∧ 𝑞	~(𝑝 ∧ 𝑞)	𝑝 ⋁ ~(𝑝 ∧ 𝑞)
T	T	T	F	T
T	F	F	T	T
F	T	F	T	T
F	F	F	T	T
From the truth table, we can see that regardless of the truth values of 𝑝 and 𝑞, the proposition 𝑝 ⋁ ~(𝑝 ∧ 𝑞) always evaluates to true (T).

Therefore, we can conclude that the proposition 𝑝 ⋁ ~(𝑝 ∧ 𝑞) is a tautology.

106.	Find the all-possible solutions of  217𝑥 ≡  238 (𝑚𝑜𝑑 327).    
ChatGPT
To find all possible solutions of the congruence equation 217𝑥 ≡ 238 (mod 327), we need to solve for 𝑥.

First, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 217 and 327, which is 1:

217𝑥 ≡ 238 (mod 327)

Next, we need to find the modular inverse of 217 modulo 327. Let's use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find it:

327 = 1 * 217 + 110
217 = 1 * 110 + 107
110 = 1 * 107 + 3
107 = 35 * 3 + 2
3 = 1 * 2 + 1

Now, we can work our way back up to find the coefficients of the linear combination:

1 = 3 - 1 * 2
= 3 - 1 * (107 - 35 * 3)
= 36 * 3 - 1 * 107
= 36 * (110 - 107) - 1 * 107
= 36 * 110 - 37 * 107
= 36 * 110 - 37 * (217 - 110)
= 73 * 110 - 37 * 217
= 73 * (327 - 217) - 37 * 217
= 73 * 327 - 110 * 217

Therefore, the modular inverse of 217 modulo 327 is -110 (or 217) since we are working in the modulo 327 system.

Now, we can multiply both sides of the congruence equation by the modular inverse (-110 or 217):

-110 * 217𝑥 ≡ -110 * 238 (mod 327)
-23870𝑥 ≡ -26080 (mod 327)

Since -110 * 217 ≡ 1 (mod 327), we have:

𝑥 ≡ -26080 ≡ 47 (mod 327)

So, the possible solutions for 𝑥 are all the integers that are congruent to 47 modulo 327.

107.	Prove that the relation R defined by “a is congruent to b modulo m” on the set of integers (ℤ) is an equivalence relation. 
ChatGPT
To prove that the relation R defined by "a is congruent to b modulo m" on the set of integers (ℤ) is an equivalence relation, we need to show that it satisfies three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.

Reflexivity:
For any integer a, a is congruent to itself modulo m. In other words, a ≡ a (mod m). Therefore, the relation R is reflexive.

Symmetry:
If a is congruent to b modulo m, then b is also congruent to a modulo m. In other words, if a ≡ b (mod m), then b ≡ a (mod m). Therefore, the relation R is symmetric.

Transitivity:
If a is congruent to b modulo m, and b is congruent to c modulo m, then a is also congruent to c modulo m. In other words, if a ≡ b (mod m) and b ≡ c (mod m), then a ≡ c (mod m). Therefore, the relation R is transitive.

Since the relation R satisfies all three properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, we can conclude that the relation R defined by "a is congruent to b modulo m" on the set of integers (ℤ) is an equivalence relation.

109.	Find the multiplicative inverse of  29 in z*41
ChatGPT
To find the multiplicative inverse of 29 in ℤ*41 (the set of nonzero integers modulo 41), we need to find another number x such that the product of 29 and x is congruent to 1 modulo 41.

In other words, we want to find x such that 29x ≡ 1 (mod 41).

To solve this congruence equation, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Step 1: Apply the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of 29 and 41:

41 = 1 × 29 + 12
29 = 2 × 12 + 5
12 = 2 × 5 + 2
5 = 2 × 2 + 1

Step 2: Now, we can work backward to express 1 as a linear combination of 29 and 41:

1 = 5 - 2 × 2
= 5 - 2 × (12 - 2 × 5)
= 5 - 2 × 12 + 4 × 5
= -2 × 12 + 5 × 5
= -2 × 12 + 5 × (29 - 2 × 12)
= 5 × 29 - 12 × 2
= 5 × 29 - 12 × (41 - 1 × 29)
= 5 × 29 - 12 × 41 + 12 × 29
= 17 × 29 - 12 × 41

Step 3: Take the coefficient of 29, which is 17, as the multiplicative inverse of 29 modulo 41.

Therefore, the multiplicative inverse of 29 in ℤ*41 is 17.

110.	Show that center of a group denoted by Z(G) and defined by {x | ax = xa,  ∀ a ∈ G} is an abelian subgroup of any group G. Hence show that if G is cyclic then Z(G) is so.  
 
ChatGPT
To show that the center of a group, denoted by Z(G), is an abelian subgroup of any group G, we need to prove two properties:

Z(G) is a subgroup of G.
Z(G) is abelian, meaning that for any elements x, y in Z(G), xy = yx.
Let's prove these properties:

Z(G) is a subgroup of G:

Closure: Let x, y be elements of Z(G). For any element a in G, we have:
(xy)a = x(ya) (by associativity of the group operation)
= x(ay) (since y is in Z(G))
= (xa)y (by associativity of the group operation)
= (ax)y (since x is in Z(G))
= a(xy) (by associativity of the group operation)
This shows that xy is in Z(G), so Z(G) is closed under the group operation.
Identity: The identity element e of G is also in Z(G) since for any element a in G, we have ae = ea = a.
Inverses: For any element x in Z(G), its inverse x^(-1) is also in Z(G) since for any element a in G, we have:
(x^(-1))a = x^(-1)a = ax^(-1) = a(x^(-1)).
Therefore, Z(G) is a subgroup of G.
Z(G) is abelian:
Let x, y be elements of Z(G). For any element a in G, we have:
xy = (yx)a (by the definition of Z(G))
= y(xa) (by associativity of the group operation)
= y(ax) (since x is in Z(G))
= (ya)x (by associativity of the group operation)
= (ay)x (since y is in Z(G))
= a(yx) (by associativity of the group operation)
This shows that xy = yx, so Z(G) is abelian.

Therefore, the center of any group G, denoted by Z(G), is an abelian subgroup of G.

Now, let's show that if G is a cyclic group, then Z(G) is also a cyclic group.
Suppose G is a cyclic group generated by an element g. That is, every element of G can be written as a power of g.
Let x be an element in Z(G), which means gx = xg for all g in G.
Since G is cyclic, x can be written as a power of g, say x = g^k for some integer k.
Now, for any g' in G, we have:
g'x = g'g^k = (g'g)g^(k-1) = gg'g^(k-1) = xg' (using the commutativity of g' and g)
This shows that x is in Z(G) as well.
Therefore, Z(G) is also cyclic, generated by the same element g.

In conclusion, if G is a cyclic group, then its center Z(G) is also a cyclic group.
